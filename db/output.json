I have seldom heard\r\nhim mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses\r\nand predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt\r\nany emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that\r\none particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but\r\nadmirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect\r\nreasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a\r\nlover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never\r\nspoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They\r\nwere admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the\r\nveil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner\r\nto admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\r\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which\r\nmight throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a\r\nsensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power\r\nlenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a\r\nnature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and\r\nthat woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us\r\naway from each other. My own complete happiness, and the\r\nhome-centred interests which rise up around the man who first\r\nfinds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to\r\nabsorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of\r\nsociety with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in\r\nBaker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from\r\nweek to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the\r\ndrug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still,\r\nas ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his\r\nimmense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in\r\nfollowing out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which\r\nhad been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time\r\nto time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons\r\nto Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\r\nof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,\r\nand finally of the mission which he had accomplished so\r\ndelicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.\r\nBeyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely\r\nshared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of\r\nmy former friend and companion.\r\n\r\nOne night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was\r\nreturning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to\r\ncivil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I\r\npassed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated\r\nin my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the\r\nStudy in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes\r\nagain, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.\r\nHis rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw\r\nhis tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against\r\nthe blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head\r\nsunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\r\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their\r\nown story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his\r\ndrug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new\r\nproblem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which\r\nhad formerly been in part my own.\r\n\r\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I\r\nthink, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly\r\neye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,\r\nand indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he\r\nstood before the fire and looked me over in his singular\r\nintrospective fashion.\r\n\r\n\"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have\r\nput on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seven!\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more,\r\nI fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not\r\ntell me that you intended to go into harness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, how do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\r\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and\r\ncareless servant girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Holmes,\" said I, \"this is too much. You would certainly\r\nhave been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true\r\nthat I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful\r\nmess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you\r\ndeduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has\r\ngiven her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"It is simplicity itself,\" said he; \"my eyes tell me that on the\r\ninside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it,\r\nthe leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they\r\nhave been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round\r\nthe edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.\r\nHence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile\r\nweather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting\r\nspecimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a\r\ngentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black\r\nmark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge\r\non the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted\r\nhis stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce\r\nhim to be an active member of the medical profession.\"\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\r\nprocess of deduction. \"When I hear you give your reasons,\" I\r\nremarked, \"the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously\r\nsimple that I could easily do it myself, though at each\r\nsuccessive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you\r\nexplain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good\r\nas yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing\r\nhimself down into an armchair. \"You see, but you do not observe.\r\nThe distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen\r\nthe steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frequently.\"\r\n\r\n\"How often?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, some hundreds of times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how many are there?\"\r\n\r\n\"How many? I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is\r\njust my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,\r\nbecause I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are\r\ninterested in these little problems, and since you are good\r\nenough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you\r\nmay be interested in this.\" He threw over a sheet of thick,\r\npink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.\r\n\"It came by the last post,\" said he. \"Read it aloud.\"\r\n\r\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\r\n\r\n\"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight\r\no'clock,\" it said, \"a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a\r\nmatter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of\r\nthe royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may\r\nsafely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which\r\ncan hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all\r\nquarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do\r\nnot take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is indeed a mystery,\" I remarked. \"What do you imagine that\r\nit means?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before\r\none has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit\r\ntheories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself.\r\nWhat do you deduce from it?\"\r\n\r\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n\"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\" I remarked,\r\nendeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. \"Such paper\r\ncould not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly\r\nstrong and stiff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peculiar--that is the very word,\" said Holmes. \"It is not an\r\nEnglish paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\"\r\n\r\nI did so, and saw a large \"E\" with a small \"g,\" a \"P,\" and a\r\nlarge \"G\" with a small \"t\" woven into the texture of the paper.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of that?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for\r\n'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a\r\ncustomary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for\r\n'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental\r\nGazetteer.\" He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.\r\n\"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking\r\ncountry--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being\r\nthe scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\r\nglass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you\r\nmake of that?\" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue\r\ntriumphant cloud from his cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"The paper was made in Bohemia,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you\r\nnote the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of\r\nyou we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian\r\ncould not have written that. It is the German who is so\r\nuncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover\r\nwhat is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and\r\nprefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if\r\nI am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and\r\ngrating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the\r\nbell. Holmes whistled.\r\n\r\n\"A pair, by the sound,\" said he. \"Yes,\" he continued, glancing\r\nout of the window. \"A nice little brougham and a pair of\r\nbeauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in\r\nthis case, Watson, if there is nothing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that I had better go, Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my\r\nBoswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity\r\nto miss it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your client--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he\r\ncomes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best\r\nattention.\"\r\n\r\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and\r\nin the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there\r\nwas a loud and authoritative tap.\r\n\r\n\"Come in!\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six\r\ninches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His\r\ndress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked\r\nupon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed\r\nacross the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while\r\nthe deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined\r\nwith flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch\r\nwhich consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended\r\nhalfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with\r\nrich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence\r\nwhich was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a\r\nbroad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\r\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black\r\nvizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,\r\nfor his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower\r\npart of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,\r\nwith a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive\r\nof resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\r\n\r\n\"You had my note?\" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a\r\nstrongly marked German accent. \"I told you that I would call.\" He\r\nlooked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to\r\naddress.\r\n\r\n\"Pray take a seat,\" said Holmes. \"This is my friend and\r\ncolleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me\r\nin my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.\r\nI understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour\r\nand discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most\r\nextreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate\r\nwith you alone.\"\r\n\r\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me\r\nback into my chair. \"It is both, or none,\" said he. \"You may say\r\nbefore this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \"Then I must begin,\" said\r\nhe, \"by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at\r\nthe end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At\r\npresent it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it\r\nmay have an influence upon European history.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"And I.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse this mask,\" continued our strange visitor. \"The\r\naugust person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to\r\nyou, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have\r\njust called myself is not exactly my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was aware of it,\" said Holmes dryly.\r\n\r\n\"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution\r\nhas to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense\r\nscandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of\r\nEurope. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House\r\nof Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was also aware of that,\" murmured Holmes, settling himself\r\ndown in his armchair and closing his eyes.\r\n\r\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\r\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him\r\nas the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.\r\nHolmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his\r\ngigantic client.\r\n\r\n\"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\" he\r\nremarked, \"I should be better able to advise you.\"\r\n\r\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\r\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he\r\ntore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \"You\r\nare right,\" he cried; \"I am the King. Why should I attempt to\r\nconceal it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, indeed?\" murmured Holmes. \"Your Majesty had not spoken\r\nbefore I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich\r\nSigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and\r\nhereditary King of Bohemia.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can understand,\" said our strange visitor, sitting down\r\nonce more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \"you\r\ncan understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in\r\nmy own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not\r\nconfide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I\r\nhave come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, pray consult,\" said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\r\n\r\n\"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a\r\nlengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known\r\nadventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\" murmured Holmes without\r\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of\r\ndocketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it\r\nwas difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not\r\nat once furnish information. In this case I found her biography\r\nsandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a\r\nstaff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea\r\nfishes.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see!\" said Holmes. \"Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year\r\n1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera\r\nof Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in\r\nLondon--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled\r\nwith this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and\r\nis now desirous of getting those letters back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely so. But how--\"\r\n\r\n\"Was there a secret marriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\n\"No legal papers or certificates?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should\r\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is\r\nshe to prove their authenticity?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is the writing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh, pooh! Forgery.\"\r\n\r\n\"My private note-paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stolen.\"\r\n\r\n\"My own seal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Imitated.\"\r\n\r\n\"My photograph.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bought.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were both in the photograph.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\r\nindiscretion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was mad--insane.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have compromised yourself seriously.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be recovered.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have tried and failed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\"\r\n\r\n\"She will not sell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stolen, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked\r\nher house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice\r\nshe has been waylaid. There has been no result.\"\r\n\r\n\"No sign of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely none.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed. \"It is quite a pretty little problem,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"But a very serious one to me,\" returned the King reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the\r\nphotograph?\"\r\n\r\n\"To ruin me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am about to be married.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I have heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the\r\nKing of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her\r\nfamily. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a\r\ndoubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Irene Adler?\"\r\n\r\n\"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I\r\nknow that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul\r\nof steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and\r\nthe mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry\r\nanother woman, there are no lengths to which she would not\r\ngo--none.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the\r\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then we have three days yet,\" said Holmes with a yawn. \"That\r\nis very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to\r\nlook into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in\r\nLondon for the present?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the\r\nCount Von Kramm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, as to money?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have carte blanche.\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom\r\nto have that photograph.\"\r\n\r\n\"And for present expenses?\"\r\n\r\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak\r\nand laid it on the table.\r\n\r\n\"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in\r\nnotes,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and\r\nhanded it to him.\r\n\r\n\"And Mademoiselle's address?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes took a note of it. \"One other question,\" said he. \"Was the\r\nphotograph a cabinet?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon\r\nhave some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\" he added,\r\nas the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \"If\r\nyou will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three\r\no'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had\r\nnot yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the\r\nhouse shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down\r\nbeside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,\r\nhowever long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his\r\ninquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and\r\nstrange features which were associated with the two crimes which\r\nI have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the\r\nexalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.\r\nIndeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my\r\nfriend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of\r\na situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a\r\npleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\r\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most\r\ninextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable\r\nsuccess that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to\r\nenter into my head.\r\n\r\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a\r\ndrunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an\r\ninflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.\r\nAccustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of\r\ndisguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it\r\nwas indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he\r\nemerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.\r\nPutting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in\r\nfront of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, really!\" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again\r\nuntil he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I\r\nemployed my morning, or what I ended by doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the\r\nhabits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,\r\nhowever. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this\r\nmorning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a\r\nwonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of\r\nthem, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found\r\nBriony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but\r\nbuilt out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock\r\nto the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well\r\nfurnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those\r\npreposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.\r\nBehind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\r\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round\r\nit and examined it closely from every point of view, but without\r\nnoting anything else of interest.\r\n\r\n\"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that\r\nthere was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the\r\ngarden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses,\r\nand received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two\r\nfills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire\r\nabout Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in\r\nthe neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but\r\nwhose biographies I was compelled to listen to.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what of Irene Adler?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is\r\nthe daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the\r\nSerpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts,\r\ndrives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for\r\ndinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.\r\nHas only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,\r\nhandsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and\r\noften twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See\r\nthe advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him\r\nhome a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.\r\nWhen I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up\r\nand down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan\r\nof campaign.\r\n\r\n\"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the\r\nmatter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the\r\nrelation between them, and what the object of his repeated\r\nvisits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the\r\nformer, she had probably transferred the photograph to his\r\nkeeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this\r\nquestion depended whether I should continue my work at Briony\r\nLodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the\r\nTemple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my\r\ninquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to\r\nlet you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the\r\nsituation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am following you closely,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab\r\ndrove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a\r\nremarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently\r\nthe man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a\r\ngreat hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the\r\nmaid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly\r\nat home.\r\n\r\n\"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch\r\nglimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and\r\ndown, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see\r\nnothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than\r\nbefore. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from\r\nhis pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he\r\nshouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to\r\nthe Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if\r\nyou do it in twenty minutes!'\r\n\r\n\"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do\r\nwell to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau,\r\nthe coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under\r\nhis ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of\r\nthe buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall\r\ndoor and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment,\r\nbut she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\r\n\r\n\"'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a\r\nsovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'\r\n\r\n\"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing\r\nwhether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her\r\nlandau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked\r\ntwice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could\r\nobject. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign\r\nif you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to\r\ntwelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\r\n\r\n\"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the\r\nothers were there before us. The cab and the landau with their\r\nsteaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid\r\nthe man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there\r\nsave the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who\r\nseemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three\r\nstanding in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side\r\naisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.\r\nSuddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\r\nme, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'\r\n\r\n\"'What then?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'\r\n\r\n\"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was\r\nI found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear,\r\nand vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally\r\nassisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to\r\nGodfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and\r\nthere was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady\r\non the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was\r\nthe most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my\r\nlife, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just\r\nnow. It seems that there had been some informality about their\r\nlicense, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them\r\nwithout a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance\r\nsaved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in\r\nsearch of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean\r\nto wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\" said I; \"and what\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if\r\nthe pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate\r\nvery prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church\r\ndoor, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and\r\nshe to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as\r\nusual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove\r\naway in different directions, and I went off to make my own\r\narrangements.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some cold beef and a glass of beer,\" he answered, ringing the\r\nbell. \"I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to\r\nbe busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want\r\nyour co-operation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be delighted.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mind breaking the law?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor running a chance of arrest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in a good cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the cause is excellent!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am your man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was sure that I might rely on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is it you wish?\"\r\n\r\n\"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to\r\nyou. Now,\" he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that\r\nour landlady had provided, \"I must discuss it while I eat, for I\r\nhave not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must\r\nbe on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns\r\nfrom her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to\r\noccur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must\r\nnot interfere, come what may. You understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am to be neutral?\"\r\n\r\n\"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\r\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being\r\nconveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the\r\nsitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close\r\nto that open window.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what\r\nI give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of\r\nfire. You quite follow me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Entirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing very formidable,\" he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\r\nroll from his pocket. \"It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket,\r\nfitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.\r\nYour task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire,\r\nit will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then\r\nwalk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten\r\nminutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,\r\nand at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry\r\nof fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you may entirely rely on me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I\r\nprepare for the new role I have to play.\"\r\n\r\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in\r\nthe character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist\r\nclergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white\r\ntie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and\r\nbenevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have\r\nequalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His\r\nexpression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every\r\nfresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as\r\nscience lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\r\nwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in\r\nSerpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just\r\nbeing lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge,\r\nwaiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such\r\nas I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description,\r\nbut the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On\r\nthe contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was\r\nremarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men\r\nsmoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his\r\nwheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and\r\nseveral well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with\r\ncigars in their mouths.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of\r\nthe house, \"this marriage rather simplifies matters. The\r\nphotograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are\r\nthat she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey\r\nNorton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his\r\nprincess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the\r\nphotograph?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where, indeed?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is\r\ncabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's\r\ndress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid\r\nand searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We\r\nmay take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But\r\nI am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive,\r\nand they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it\r\nover to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but\r\nshe could not tell what indirect or political influence might be\r\nbrought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she\r\nhad resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she\r\ncan lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it has twice been burgled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! They did not know how to look.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how will you look?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not look.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will get her to show me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she will refuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is\r\nher carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round\r\nthe curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which\r\nrattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of\r\nthe loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in\r\nthe hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another\r\nloafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce\r\nquarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who\r\ntook sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder,\r\nwho was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and\r\nin an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was\r\nthe centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\r\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\r\ndashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached\r\nher he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood\r\nrunning freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to\r\ntheir heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while\r\na number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle\r\nwithout taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to\r\nattend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her,\r\nhad hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her\r\nsuperb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking\r\nback into the street.\r\n\r\n\"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"He is dead,\" cried several voices.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, there's life in him!\" shouted another. \"But he'll be\r\ngone before you can get him to hospital.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a brave fellow,\" said a woman. \"They would have had the\r\nlady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a\r\ngang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable\r\nsofa. This way, please!\"\r\n\r\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out\r\nin the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings\r\nfrom my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the\r\nblinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay\r\nupon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with\r\ncompunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I\r\nknow that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life\r\nthan when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was\r\nconspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited\r\nupon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery\r\nto Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted\r\nto me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under\r\nmy ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are\r\nbut preventing her from injuring another.\r\n\r\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man\r\nwho is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the\r\nwindow. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the\r\nsignal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of \"Fire!\" The\r\nword was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of\r\nspectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and\r\nservant-maids--joined in a general shriek of \"Fire!\" Thick clouds\r\nof smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I\r\ncaught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice\r\nof Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.\r\nSlipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\r\nof the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my\r\nfriend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.\r\nHe walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we\r\nhad turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the\r\nEdgeware Road.\r\n\r\n\"You did it very nicely, Doctor,\" he remarked. \"Nothing could\r\nhave been better. It is all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have the photograph?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know where it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how did you find out?\"\r\n\r\n\"She showed me, as I told you she would.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am still in the dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to make a mystery,\" said he, laughing. \"The matter\r\nwas perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the\r\nstreet was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guessed as much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in\r\nthe palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand\r\nto my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\"\r\n\r\n\"That also I could fathom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else\r\ncould she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room\r\nwhich I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was\r\ndetermined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for\r\nair, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your\r\nchance.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did that help you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on\r\nfire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she\r\nvalues most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have\r\nmore than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the\r\nDarlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in\r\nthe Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby;\r\nan unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to\r\nme that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious\r\nto her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it.\r\nThe alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were\r\nenough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\r\nphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the\r\nright bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a\r\nglimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it\r\nwas a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed\r\nfrom the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making\r\nmy excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to\r\nattempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had\r\ncome in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to\r\nwait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\r\nto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be\r\nshown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is\r\nprobable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the\r\nphotograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain\r\nit with his own hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when will you call?\"\r\n\r\n\"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall\r\nhave a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage\r\nmay mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to\r\nthe King without delay.\"\r\n\r\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was\r\nsearching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\"\r\n\r\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the\r\ngreeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had\r\nhurried by.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard that voice before,\" said Holmes, staring down the\r\ndimly lit street. \"Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have\r\nbeen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our\r\ntoast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed\r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\n\"You have really got it!\" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by\r\neither shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have hopes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have hopes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must have a cab.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my brougham is waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that will simplify matters.\" We descended and started off\r\nonce more for Briony Lodge.\r\n\r\n\"Irene Adler is married,\" remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Married! When?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"But to whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"To an English lawyer named Norton.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she could not love him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am in hopes that she does.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why in hopes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future\r\nannoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your\r\nMajesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason\r\nwhy she should interfere with your Majesty's plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own\r\nstation! What a queen she would have made!\" He relapsed into a\r\nmoody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in\r\nSerpentine Avenue.\r\n\r\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood\r\nupon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped\r\nfrom the brougham.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"I am Mr. Holmes,\" answered my companion, looking at her with a\r\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She\r\nleft this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing\r\nCross for the Continent.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\r\nsurprise. \"Do you mean that she has left England?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never to return.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the papers?\" asked the King hoarsely. \"All is lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall see.\" He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\r\ndrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was\r\nscattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and\r\nopen drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before\r\nher flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small\r\nsliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a\r\nphotograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler\r\nherself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to\r\n\"Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\" My friend\r\ntore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at\r\nmidnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You\r\ntook me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\r\nsuspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I\r\nbegan to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had\r\nbeen told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly\r\nbe you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,\r\nyou made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\r\nsuspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind\r\nold clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress\r\nmyself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage\r\nof the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to\r\nwatch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call\r\nthem, and came down just as you departed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\r\nreally an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock\r\nHolmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and\r\nstarted for the Temple to see my husband.\r\n\r\n\"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by\r\nso formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when\r\nyou call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in\r\npeace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may\r\ndo what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly\r\nwronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a\r\nweapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\r\ntake in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to\r\npossess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\r\n\r\n                                      \"Very truly yours,\r\n                                   \"IRENE NORTON, n\u00e9e ADLER.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a woman--oh, what a woman!\" cried the King of Bohemia, when\r\nwe had all three read this epistle. \"Did I not tell you how quick\r\nand resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen?\r\nIs it not a pity that she was not on my level?\"\r\n\r\n\"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a\r\nvery different level to your Majesty,\" said Holmes coldly. \"I am\r\nsorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business\r\nto a more successful conclusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, my dear sir,\" cried the King; \"nothing could be\r\nmore successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The\r\nphotograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can\r\nreward you. This ring--\" He slipped an emerald snake ring from\r\nhis finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more\r\nhighly,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"You have but to name it.\"\r\n\r\n\"This photograph!\"\r\n\r\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Irene's photograph!\" he cried. \"Certainly, if you wish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the\r\nmatter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning.\" He\r\nbowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the\r\nKing had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his\r\nchambers.\r\n\r\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom\r\nof Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were\r\nbeaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the\r\ncleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And\r\nwhen he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her\r\nphotograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\r\n\r\nI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the\r\nautumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a\r\nvery stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.\r\nWith an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when\r\nHolmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door\r\nbehind me.\r\n\r\n\"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear\r\nWatson,\" he said cordially.\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid that you were engaged.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I am. Very much so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I can wait in the next room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and\r\nhelper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no\r\ndoubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.\"\r\n\r\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of\r\ngreeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small\r\nfat-encircled eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Try the settee,\" said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and\r\nputting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in\r\njudicial moods. \"I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love\r\nof all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum\r\nroutine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by\r\nthe enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you\r\nwill excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own\r\nlittle adventures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\" I\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we\r\nwent into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary\r\nSutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary\r\ncombinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more\r\ndaring than any effort of the imagination.\"\r\n\r\n\"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my\r\nview, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you\r\nuntil your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to\r\nbe right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call\r\nupon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to\r\nbe one of the most singular which I have listened to for some\r\ntime. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique\r\nthings are very often connected not with the larger but with the\r\nsmaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for\r\ndoubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I\r\nhave heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present\r\ncase is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is\r\ncertainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.\r\nPerhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to\r\nrecommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend\r\nDr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the\r\npeculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every\r\npossible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some\r\nslight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide\r\nmyself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my\r\nmemory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the\r\nfacts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\"\r\n\r\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some\r\nlittle pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the\r\ninside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the\r\nadvertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper\r\nflattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and\r\nendeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the\r\nindications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.\r\n\r\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor\r\nbore every mark of being an average commonplace British\r\ntradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey\r\nshepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat,\r\nunbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy\r\nAlbert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as\r\nan ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a\r\nwrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether,\r\nlook as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save\r\nhis blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and\r\ndiscontent upon his features.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook\r\nhis head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.\r\n\"Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual\r\nlabour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has\r\nbeen in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of\r\nwriting lately, I can deduce nothing else.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger\r\nupon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\r\n\r\n\"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.\r\nHolmes?\" he asked. \"How did you know, for example, that I did\r\nmanual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's\r\ncarpenter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger\r\nthan your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more\r\ndeveloped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,\r\nespecially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you\r\nuse an arc-and-compass breastpin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?\"\r\n\r\n\"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for\r\nfive inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the\r\nelbow where you rest it upon the desk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but China?\"\r\n\r\n\"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right\r\nwrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small\r\nstudy of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature\r\nof the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a\r\ndelicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I\r\nsee a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter\r\nbecomes even more simple.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \"Well, I never!\" said he. \"I\r\nthought at first that you had done something clever, but I see\r\nthat there was nothing in it, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I begin to think, Watson,\" said Holmes, \"that I make a mistake\r\nin explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my\r\npoor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I\r\nam so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have got it now,\" he answered with his thick red finger\r\nplanted halfway down the column. \"Here it is. This is what began\r\nit all. You just read it for yourself, sir.\"\r\n\r\nI took the paper from him and read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late\r\nEzekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now\r\nanother vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a\r\nsalary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services. All\r\nred-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age\r\nof twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at\r\neleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7\r\nPope's Court, Fleet Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth does this mean?\" I ejaculated after I had twice\r\nread over the extraordinary announcement.\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when\r\nin high spirits. \"It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?\"\r\nsaid he. \"And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us\r\nall about yourself, your household, and the effect which this\r\nadvertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note,\r\nDoctor, of the paper and the date.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock\r\nHolmes,\" said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \"I have a small\r\npawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a\r\nvery large affair, and of late years it has not done more than\r\njust give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants,\r\nbut now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but\r\nthat he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the name of this obliging youth?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth,\r\neither. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter\r\nassistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better\r\nhimself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after\r\nall, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employ\u00e9 who\r\ncomes under the full market price. It is not a common experience\r\namong employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is\r\nnot as remarkable as your advertisement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he has his faults, too,\" said Mr. Wilson. \"Never was such a\r\nfellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought\r\nto be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar\r\nlike a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his\r\nmain fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice\r\nin him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is still with you, I presume?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple\r\ncooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the\r\nhouse, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very\r\nquietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads\r\nand pay our debts, if we do nothing more.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.\r\nSpaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight\r\nweeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:\r\n\r\n\"'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'\r\n\r\n\"'Why that?' I asks.\r\n\r\n\"'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the\r\nRed-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who\r\ngets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than\r\nthere are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what\r\nto do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's\r\na nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'\r\n\r\n\"'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a\r\nvery stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of\r\nmy having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting\r\nmy foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what\r\nwas going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\r\n\r\n\"'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he\r\nasked with his eyes open.\r\n\r\n\"'Never.'\r\n\r\n\"'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one\r\nof the vacancies.'\r\n\r\n\"'And what are they worth?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight,\r\nand it need not interfere very much with one's other\r\noccupations.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears,\r\nfor the business has not been over-good for some years, and an\r\nextra couple of hundred would have been very handy.\r\n\r\n\"'Tell me all about it,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for\r\nyourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address\r\nwhere you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out,\r\nthe League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah\r\nHopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself\r\nred-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men;\r\nso when he died it was found that he had left his enormous\r\nfortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the\r\ninterest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of\r\nthat colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to\r\ndo.'\r\n\r\n\"'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who\r\nwould apply.'\r\n\r\n\"'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is\r\nreally confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had\r\nstarted from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the\r\nold town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your\r\napplying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but\r\nreal bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr.\r\nWilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be\r\nworth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a\r\nfew hundred pounds.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,\r\nthat my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed\r\nto me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I\r\nstood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent\r\nSpaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might\r\nprove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for\r\nthe day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to\r\nhave a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for\r\nthe address that was given us in the advertisement.\r\n\r\n\"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From\r\nnorth, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in\r\nhis hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.\r\nFleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court\r\nlooked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought\r\nthere were so many in the whole country as were brought together\r\nby that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they\r\nwere--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay;\r\nbut, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real\r\nvivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I\r\nwould have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear\r\nof it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and\r\npulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up\r\nto the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream\r\nupon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back\r\ndejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found\r\nourselves in the office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your experience has been a most entertaining one,\" remarked\r\nHolmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge\r\npinch of snuff. \"Pray continue your very interesting statement.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs\r\nand a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that\r\nwas even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate\r\nas he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in\r\nthem which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem\r\nto be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn\r\ncame the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of\r\nthe others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he\r\nmight have a private word with us.\r\n\r\n\"'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is\r\nwilling to fill a vacancy in the League.'\r\n\r\n\"'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has\r\nevery requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so\r\nfine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and\r\ngazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he\r\nplunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\"'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will,\r\nhowever, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.'\r\nWith that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I\r\nyelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as\r\nhe released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we\r\nhave to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and\r\nonce by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which\r\nwould disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the\r\nwindow and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the\r\nvacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,\r\nand the folk all trooped away in different directions until there\r\nwas not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\n\"'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of\r\nthe pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are\r\nyou a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'\r\n\r\n\"I answered that I had not.\r\n\r\n\"His face fell immediately.\r\n\r\n\"'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am\r\nsorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the\r\npropagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their\r\nmaintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a\r\nbachelor.'\r\n\r\n\"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was\r\nnot to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for\r\na few minutes he said that it would be all right.\r\n\r\n\"'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be\r\nfatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a\r\nhead of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your\r\nnew duties?'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,'\r\nsaid I.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding.\r\n'I should be able to look after that for you.'\r\n\r\n\"'What would be the hours?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Ten to two.'\r\n\r\n\"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.\r\nHolmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just\r\nbefore pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in\r\nthe mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man,\r\nand that he would see to anything that turned up.\r\n\r\n\"'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'\r\n\r\n\"'Is 4 pounds a week.'\r\n\r\n\"'And the work?'\r\n\r\n\"'Is purely nominal.'\r\n\r\n\"'What do you call purely nominal?'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the\r\nbuilding, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole\r\nposition forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You\r\ndon't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office\r\nduring that time.'\r\n\r\n\"'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,'\r\nsaid I.\r\n\r\n\"'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness\r\nnor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose\r\nyour billet.'\r\n\r\n\"'And the work?'\r\n\r\n\"'Is to copy out the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica.\" There is the first\r\nvolume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and\r\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be\r\nready to-morrow?'\r\n\r\n\"'Certainly,' I answered.\r\n\r\n\"'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you\r\nonce more on the important position which you have been fortunate\r\nenough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with\r\nmy assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased\r\nat my own good fortune.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in\r\nlow spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the\r\nwhole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its\r\nobject might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past\r\nbelief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay\r\nsuch a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the\r\n'Encyclopaedia Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to\r\ncheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the\r\nwhole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look\r\nat it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a\r\nquill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for\r\nPope's Court.\r\n\r\n\"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as\r\npossible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross\r\nwas there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off\r\nupon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from\r\ntime to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he\r\nbade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had\r\nwritten, and locked the door of the office after me.\r\n\r\n\"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the\r\nmanager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my\r\nweek's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week\r\nafter. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I\r\nleft at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only\r\nonce of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at\r\nall. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an\r\ninstant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet\r\nwas such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk\r\nthe loss of it.\r\n\r\n\"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about\r\nAbbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and\r\nhoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very\r\nlong. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly\r\nfilled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole\r\nbusiness came to an end.\"\r\n\r\n\"To an end?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as\r\nusual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a\r\nlittle square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the\r\npanel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet\r\nof note-paper. It read in this fashion:\r\n\r\n                  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\r\n\r\n                           IS\r\n\r\n                        DISSOLVED.\r\n\r\n                     October 9, 1890.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the\r\nrueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so\r\ncompletely overtopped every other consideration that we both\r\nburst out into a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot see that there is anything very funny,\" cried our\r\nclient, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. \"If you can\r\ndo nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from\r\nwhich he had half risen. \"I really wouldn't miss your case for\r\nthe world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you\r\nwill excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.\r\nPray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the\r\ndoor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called\r\nat the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything\r\nabout it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant\r\nliving on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me\r\nwhat had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had\r\nnever heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan\r\nRoss was. He answered that the name was new to him.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'\r\n\r\n\"'What, the red-headed man?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor\r\nand was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new\r\npremises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'\r\n\r\n\"'Where could I find him?'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17\r\nKing Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'\r\n\r\n\"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was\r\na manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever\r\nheard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did you do then?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my\r\nassistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say\r\nthat if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite\r\ngood enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place\r\nwithout a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough\r\nto give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right\r\naway to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you did very wisely,\" said Holmes. \"Your case is an\r\nexceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.\r\nFrom what you have told me I think that it is possible that\r\ngraver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grave enough!\" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. \"Why, I have lost four\r\npound a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as you are personally concerned,\" remarked Holmes, \"I do\r\nnot see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary\r\nleague. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some\r\n30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have\r\ngained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have\r\nlost nothing by them.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are,\r\nand what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a\r\nprank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it\r\ncost them two and thirty pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first,\r\none or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who\r\nfirst called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he\r\nbeen with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"About a month then.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did he come?\"\r\n\r\n\"In answer to an advertisement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he the only applicant?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I had a dozen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you pick him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he was handy and would come cheap.\"\r\n\r\n\"At half-wages, in fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,\r\nthough he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon\r\nhis forehead.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. \"I thought\r\nas much,\" said he. \"Have you ever observed that his ears are\r\npierced for earrings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he\r\nwas a lad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum!\" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. \"He is still\r\nwith you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And has your business been attended to in your absence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an\r\nopinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is\r\nSaturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Watson,\" said Holmes when our visitor had left us, \"what\r\ndo you make of it all?\"\r\n\r\n\"I make nothing of it,\" I answered frankly. \"It is a most\r\nmysterious business.\"\r\n\r\n\"As a rule,\" said Holmes, \"the more bizarre a thing is the less\r\nmysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless\r\ncrimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is\r\nthe most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do, then?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"To smoke,\" he answered. \"It is quite a three pipe problem, and I\r\nbeg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes.\" He curled\r\nhimself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his\r\nhawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his\r\nblack clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.\r\nI had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and\r\nindeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his\r\nchair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put\r\nhis pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon,\" he\r\nremarked. \"What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare\r\nyou for a few hours?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very\r\nabsorbing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City\r\nfirst, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that\r\nthere is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is\r\nrather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is\r\nintrospective, and I want to introspect. Come along!\"\r\n\r\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short\r\nwalk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular\r\nstory which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky,\r\nlittle, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy\r\ntwo-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in\r\nenclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded\r\nlaurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and\r\nuncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with\r\n\"JABEZ WILSON\" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced\r\nthe place where our red-headed client carried on his business.\r\nSherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side\r\nand looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between\r\npuckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down\r\nagain to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally\r\nhe returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously\r\nupon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up\r\nto the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a\r\nbright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Holmes, \"I only wished to ask you how you would\r\ngo from here to the Strand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Third right, fourth left,\" answered the assistant promptly,\r\nclosing the door.\r\n\r\n\"Smart fellow, that,\" observed Holmes as we walked away. \"He is,\r\nin my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring\r\nI am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known\r\nsomething of him before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Evidently,\" said I, \"Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good\r\ndeal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you\r\ninquired your way merely in order that you might see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The knees of his trousers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I expected to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you beat the pavement?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We\r\nare spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg\r\nSquare. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\"\r\n\r\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the\r\ncorner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a\r\ncontrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was\r\none of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City\r\nto the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense\r\nstream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward,\r\nwhile the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of\r\npedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line\r\nof fine shops and stately business premises that they really\r\nabutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square\r\nwhich we had just quitted.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see,\" said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing\r\nalong the line, \"I should like just to remember the order of the\r\nhouses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of\r\nLondon. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little\r\nnewspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank,\r\nthe Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building\r\ndepot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,\r\nDoctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A\r\nsandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where\r\nall is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no\r\nred-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a\r\nvery capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All\r\nthe afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect\r\nhappiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the\r\nmusic, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes\r\nwere as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the\r\nrelentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was\r\npossible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature\r\nalternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and\r\nastuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction\r\nagainst the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally\r\npredominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from\r\nextreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was\r\nnever so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been\r\nlounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his\r\nblack-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase\r\nwould suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning\r\npower would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were\r\nunacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a\r\nman whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him\r\nthat afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I\r\nfelt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set\r\nhimself to hunt down.\r\n\r\n\"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,\" he remarked as we\r\nemerged.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it would be as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This\r\nbusiness at Coburg Square is serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why serious?\"\r\n\r\n\"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to\r\nbelieve that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being\r\nSaturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"At what time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten will be early enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be at Baker Street at ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger,\r\nso kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\" He waved his\r\nhand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was\r\nalways oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings\r\nwith Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had\r\nseen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that\r\nhe saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to\r\nhappen, while to me the whole business was still confused and\r\ngrotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought\r\nover it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed\r\ncopier of the \"Encyclopaedia\" down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg\r\nSquare, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.\r\nWhat was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?\r\nWhere were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from\r\nHolmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a\r\nformidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to\r\npuzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside\r\nuntil night should bring an explanation.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my\r\nway across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker\r\nStreet. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered\r\nthe passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering\r\nhis room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men,\r\none of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police\r\nagent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a\r\nvery shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Our party is complete,\" said Holmes, buttoning up his\r\npea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.\r\n\"Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me\r\nintroduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in\r\nto-night's adventure.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,\" said Jones in\r\nhis consequential way. \"Our friend here is a wonderful man for\r\nstarting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do\r\nthe running down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\"\r\nobserved Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,\" said\r\nthe police agent loftily. \"He has his own little methods, which\r\nare, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical\r\nand fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It\r\nis not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of\r\nthe Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly\r\ncorrect than the official force.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\" said the\r\nstranger with deference. \"Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.\r\nIt is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I\r\nhave not had my rubber.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you will find,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"that you will\r\nplay for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and\r\nthat the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather,\r\nthe stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will\r\nbe the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a\r\nyoung man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his\r\nprofession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on\r\nany criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John\r\nClay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been\r\nto Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and\r\nthough we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to\r\nfind the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week,\r\nand be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\r\nI've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.\r\nI've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I\r\nagree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is\r\npast ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two\r\nwill take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the\r\nsecond.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive\r\nand lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in\r\nthe afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit\r\nstreets until we emerged into Farrington Street.\r\n\r\n\"We are close there now,\" my friend remarked. \"This fellow\r\nMerryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the\r\nmatter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is\r\nnot a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.\r\nHe has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as\r\ntenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we\r\nare, and they are waiting for us.\"\r\n\r\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had\r\nfound ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and,\r\nfollowing the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a\r\nnarrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.\r\nWithin there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive\r\niron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding\r\nstone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr.\r\nMerryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us\r\ndown a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a\r\nthird door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all\r\nround with crates and massive boxes.\r\n\r\n\"You are not very vulnerable from above,\" Holmes remarked as he\r\nheld up the lantern and gazed about him.\r\n\r\n\"Nor from below,\" said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon\r\nthe flags which lined the floor. \"Why, dear me, it sounds quite\r\nhollow!\" he remarked, looking up in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\" said Holmes\r\nseverely. \"You have already imperilled the whole success of our\r\nexpedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit\r\ndown upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\"\r\n\r\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a\r\nvery injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his\r\nknees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens,\r\nbegan to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few\r\nseconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again\r\nand put his glass in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"We have at least an hour before us,\" he remarked, \"for they can\r\nhardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.\r\nThen they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their\r\nwork the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at\r\npresent, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of\r\nthe City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.\r\nMerryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to\r\nyou that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of\r\nLondon should take a considerable interest in this cellar at\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is our French gold,\" whispered the director. \"We have had\r\nseveral warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your French gold?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources\r\nand borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of\r\nFrance. It has become known that we have never had occasion to\r\nunpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The\r\ncrate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between\r\nlayers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at\r\npresent than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the\r\ndirectors have had misgivings upon the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which were very well justified,\" observed Holmes. \"And now it is\r\ntime that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an\r\nhour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr.\r\nMerryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.\"\r\n\r\n\"And sit in the dark?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and\r\nI thought that, as we were a partie carr\u00e9e, you might have your\r\nrubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have\r\ngone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And,\r\nfirst of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men,\r\nand though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us\r\nsome harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate,\r\nand do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a\r\nlight upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no\r\ncompunction about shooting them down.\"\r\n\r\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case\r\nbehind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front\r\nof his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute\r\ndarkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot\r\nmetal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready\r\nto flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked\r\nup to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and\r\nsubduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the\r\nvault.\r\n\r\n\"They have but one retreat,\" whispered Holmes. \"That is back\r\nthrough the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have\r\ndone what I asked you, Jones?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent\r\nand wait.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but\r\nan hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must\r\nhave almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs\r\nwere weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my\r\nnerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my\r\nhearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle\r\nbreathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper,\r\nheavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note\r\nof the bank director. From my position I could look over the case\r\nin the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint\r\nof a light.\r\n\r\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then\r\nit lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then,\r\nwithout any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand\r\nappeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the\r\ncentre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the\r\nhand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then\r\nit was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark\r\nagain save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between\r\nthe stones.\r\n\r\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,\r\ntearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon\r\nits side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed\r\nthe light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,\r\nboyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand\r\non either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and\r\nwaist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another\r\ninstant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after\r\nhim a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face\r\nand a shock of very red hair.\r\n\r\n\"It's all clear,\" he whispered. \"Have you the chisel and the\r\nbags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the\r\ncollar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of\r\nrending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed\r\nupon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came\r\ndown on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use, John Clay,\" said Holmes blandly. \"You have no\r\nchance at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I see,\" the other answered with the utmost coolness. \"I fancy\r\nthat my pal is all right, though I see you have got his\r\ncoat-tails.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are three men waiting for him at the door,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I\r\nmust compliment you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I you,\" Holmes answered. \"Your red-headed idea was very new\r\nand effective.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll see your pal again presently,\" said Jones. \"He's quicker\r\nat climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the\r\nderbies.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\"\r\nremarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.\r\n\"You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have\r\nthe goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and\r\n'please.'\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Jones with a stare and a snigger. \"Well, would\r\nyou please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry\r\nyour Highness to the police-station?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is better,\" said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow\r\nto the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the\r\ndetective.\r\n\r\n\"Really, Mr. Holmes,\" said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them\r\nfrom the cellar, \"I do not know how the bank can thank you or\r\nrepay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated\r\nin the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts\r\nat bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.\r\nJohn Clay,\" said Holmes. \"I have been at some small expense over\r\nthis matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond\r\nthat I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in\r\nmany ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of\r\nthe Red-headed League.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You see, Watson,\" he explained in the early hours of the morning\r\nas we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \"it\r\nwas perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible\r\nobject of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of\r\nthe League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get\r\nthis not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of\r\nhours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,\r\nreally, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was\r\nno doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his\r\naccomplice's hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw\r\nhim, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands?\r\nThey put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary\r\noffice, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and\r\ntogether they manage to secure his absence every morning in the\r\nweek. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for\r\nhalf wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive\r\nfor securing the situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how could you guess what the motive was?\"\r\n\r\n\"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a\r\nmere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The\r\nman's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his\r\nhouse which could account for such elaborate preparations, and\r\nsuch an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something\r\nout of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's\r\nfondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the\r\ncellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then\r\nI made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I\r\nhad to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in\r\nLondon. He was doing something in the cellar--something which\r\ntook many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once\r\nmore? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel\r\nto some other building.\r\n\r\n\"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I\r\nsurprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was\r\nascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.\r\nIt was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the\r\nassistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had\r\nnever set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his\r\nface. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have\r\nremarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of\r\nthose hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they\r\nwere burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and\r\nSuburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I\r\nhad solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I\r\ncalled upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank\r\ndirectors, with the result that you have seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt\r\nto-night?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that\r\nthey cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other\r\nwords, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential\r\nthat they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the\r\nbullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than\r\nany other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.\r\nFor all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"You reasoned it out beautifully,\" I exclaimed in unfeigned\r\nadmiration. \"It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings\r\ntrue.\"\r\n\r\n\"It saved me from ennui,\" he answered, yawning. \"Alas! I already\r\nfeel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort\r\nto escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little\r\nproblems help me to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are a benefactor of the race,\" said I.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, perhaps, after all, it is of\r\nsome little use,\" he remarked. \"'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre\r\nc'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVENTURE III. A CASE OF IDENTITY\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side\r\nof the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \"life is infinitely\r\nstranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We\r\nwould not dare to conceive the things which are really mere\r\ncommonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window\r\nhand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the\r\nroofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the\r\nstrange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the\r\nwonderful chains of events, working through generations, and\r\nleading to the most outr\u00e9 results, it would make all fiction with\r\nits conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and\r\nunprofitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet I am not convinced of it,\" I answered. \"The cases which\r\ncome to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and\r\nvulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to\r\nits extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed,\r\nneither fascinating nor artistic.\"\r\n\r\n\"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a\r\nrealistic effect,\" remarked Holmes. \"This is wanting in the\r\npolice report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the\r\nplatitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an\r\nobserver contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend\r\nupon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.\"\r\n\r\nI smiled and shook my head. \"I can quite understand your thinking\r\nso,\" I said. \"Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser\r\nand helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout\r\nthree continents, you are brought in contact with all that is\r\nstrange and bizarre. But here\"--I picked up the morning paper\r\nfrom the ground--\"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the\r\nfirst heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his\r\nwife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without\r\nreading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of\r\ncourse, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the\r\nbruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of\r\nwriters could invent nothing more crude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\"\r\nsaid Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \"This\r\nis the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged\r\nin clearing up some small points in connection with it. The\r\nhusband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the\r\nconduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of\r\nwinding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling\r\nthem at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely\r\nto occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a\r\npinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over\r\nyou in your example.\"\r\n\r\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in\r\nthe centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his\r\nhomely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.\r\nIt is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my\r\nassistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the ring?\" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which\r\nsparkled upon his finger.\r\n\r\n\"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in\r\nwhich I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it\r\neven to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of\r\nmy little problems.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you any on hand just now?\" I asked with interest.\r\n\r\n\"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of\r\ninterest. They are important, you understand, without being\r\ninteresting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in\r\nunimportant matters that there is a field for the observation,\r\nand for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the\r\ncharm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the\r\nsimpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is\r\nthe motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter\r\nwhich has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing\r\nwhich presents any features of interest. It is possible, however,\r\nthat I may have something better before very many minutes are\r\nover, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted\r\nblinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street.\r\nLooking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite\r\nthere stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck,\r\nand a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was\r\ntilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her\r\near. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous,\r\nhesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated\r\nbackward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove\r\nbuttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves\r\nthe bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp\r\nclang of the bell.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen those symptoms before,\" said Holmes, throwing his\r\ncigarette into the fire. \"Oscillation upon the pavement always\r\nmeans an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure\r\nthat the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet\r\neven here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously\r\nwronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom\r\nis a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love\r\nmatter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or\r\ngrieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons\r\nentered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself\r\nloomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed\r\nmerchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed\r\nher with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and,\r\nhaving closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked\r\nher over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was\r\npeculiar to him.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not find,\" he said, \"that with your short sight it is a\r\nlittle trying to do so much typewriting?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did at first,\" she answered, \"but now I know where the letters\r\nare without looking.\" Then, suddenly realising the full purport\r\nof his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear\r\nand astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. \"You've\r\nheard about me, Mr. Holmes,\" she cried, \"else how could you know\r\nall that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said Holmes, laughing; \"it is my business to know\r\nthings. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others\r\noverlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege,\r\nwhose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had\r\ngiven him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as\r\nmuch for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in\r\nmy own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and\r\nI would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\" asked\r\nSherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to\r\nthe ceiling.\r\n\r\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss\r\nMary Sutherland. \"Yes, I did bang out of the house,\" she said,\r\n\"for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.\r\nWindibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to\r\nthe police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he\r\nwould do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done,\r\nit made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away\r\nto you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father,\" said Holmes, \"your stepfather, surely, since the\r\nname is different.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny,\r\ntoo, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your mother is alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr.\r\nHolmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and\r\na man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father\r\nwas a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy\r\nbusiness behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the\r\nforeman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the\r\nbusiness, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.\r\nThey got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't\r\nnear as much as father could have got if he had been alive.\"\r\n\r\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this\r\nrambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he\r\nhad listened with the greatest concentration of attention.\r\n\r\n\"Your own little income,\" he asked, \"does it come out of the\r\nbusiness?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle\r\nNed in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per\r\ncent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can\r\nonly touch the interest.\"\r\n\r\n\"You interest me extremely,\" said Holmes. \"And since you draw so\r\nlarge a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the\r\nbargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in\r\nevery way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely\r\nupon an income of about 60 pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you\r\nunderstand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a\r\nburden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while\r\nI am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the\r\ntime. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it\r\nover to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I\r\nearn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can\r\noften do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have made your position very clear to me,\" said Holmes.\r\n\"This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as\r\nfreely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your\r\nconnection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\r\n\r\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked\r\nnervously at the fringe of her jacket. \"I met him first at the\r\ngasfitters' ball,\" she said. \"They used to send father tickets\r\nwhen he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and\r\nsent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He\r\nnever did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I\r\nwanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I\r\nwas set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to\r\nprevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all\r\nfather's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing\r\nfit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much\r\nas taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do,\r\nhe went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,\r\nmother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it\r\nwas there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said Holmes, \"that when Mr. Windibank came back from\r\nFrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\r\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying\r\nanything to a woman, for she would have her way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a\r\ngentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if\r\nwe had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to\r\nsay, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father\r\ncame back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house\r\nany more.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He\r\nwouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to\r\nsay that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But\r\nthen, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to\r\nbegin with, and I had not got mine yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer\r\nwrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each\r\nother until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he\r\nused to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so\r\nthere was no need for father to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that\r\nwe took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in\r\nLeadenhall Street--and--\"\r\n\r\n\"What office?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did he live, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He slept on the premises.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you don't know his address?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you address your letters, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called\r\nfor. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be\r\nchaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady,\r\nso I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't\r\nhave that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come\r\nfrom me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the\r\nmachine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he\r\nwas of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think\r\nof.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was most suggestive,\" said Holmes. \"It has long been an axiom\r\nof mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.\r\nCan you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me\r\nin the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to\r\nbe conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his\r\nvoice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he\r\nwas young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat,\r\nand a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always\r\nwell dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just\r\nas mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather,\r\nreturned to France?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we\r\nshould marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest\r\nand made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever\r\nhappened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite\r\nright to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.\r\nMother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder\r\nof him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the\r\nweek, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to\r\nmind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother\r\nsaid she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like\r\nthat, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as\r\nhe was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do\r\nanything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the\r\ncompany has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on\r\nthe very morning of the wedding.\"\r\n\r\n\"It missed him, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for\r\nthe Friday. Was it to be in church?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near\r\nKing's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St.\r\nPancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were\r\ntwo of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a\r\nfour-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the\r\nstreet. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler\r\ndrove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and\r\nwhen the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one\r\nthere! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become\r\nof him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was\r\nlast Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything\r\nsince then to throw any light upon what became of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\" said\r\nHolmes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all\r\nthe morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to\r\nbe true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to\r\nseparate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him,\r\nand that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed\r\nstrange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since\r\ngives a meaning to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some\r\nunforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he\r\nwould not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\n\"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your father? Did you tell him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had\r\nhappened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said,\r\nwhat interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of\r\nthe church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my\r\nmoney, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,\r\nthere might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about\r\nmoney and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what\r\ncould have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me\r\nhalf-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night.\" She\r\npulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob\r\nheavily into it.\r\n\r\n\"I shall glance into the case for you,\" said Holmes, rising, \"and\r\nI have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the\r\nweight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind\r\ndwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel\r\nvanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you don't think I'll see him again?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what has happened to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an\r\naccurate description of him and any letters of his which you can\r\nspare.\"\r\n\r\n\"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle,\" said she.\r\n\"Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. And your address?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your\r\nfather's place of business?\"\r\n\r\n\"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers\r\nof Fenchurch Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will\r\nleave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given\r\nyou. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it\r\nto affect your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be\r\ntrue to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.\"\r\n\r\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was\r\nsomething noble in the simple faith of our visitor which\r\ncompelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon\r\nthe table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever\r\nshe might be summoned.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips\r\nstill pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him,\r\nand his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down\r\nfrom the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a\r\ncounsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with\r\nthe thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of\r\ninfinite languor in his face.\r\n\r\n\"Quite an interesting study, that maiden,\" he observed. \"I found\r\nher more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way,\r\nis rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you\r\nconsult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of\r\nthe sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however,\r\nthere were one or two details which were new to me. But the\r\nmaiden herself was most instructive.\"\r\n\r\n\"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite\r\ninvisible to me,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to\r\nlook, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring\r\nyou to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of\r\nthumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.\r\nNow, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a\r\nfeather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads\r\nsewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her\r\ndress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little\r\npurple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and\r\nwere worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't\r\nobserve. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a\r\ngeneral air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable,\r\neasy-going way.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\r\n\r\n\"'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have\r\nreally done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed\r\neverything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and\r\nyou have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general\r\nimpressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My\r\nfirst glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is\r\nperhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you\r\nobserve, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most\r\nuseful material for showing traces. The double line a little\r\nabove the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table,\r\nwas beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,\r\nleaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side\r\nof it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the\r\nbroadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and,\r\nobserving the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I\r\nventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed\r\nto surprise her.\"\r\n\r\n\"It surprised me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and\r\ninterested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots\r\nwhich she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were\r\nreally odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and\r\nthe other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower\r\nbuttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and\r\nfifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly\r\ndressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned,\r\nit is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what else?\" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by\r\nmy friend's incisive reasoning.\r\n\r\n\"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving\r\nhome but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right\r\nglove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see\r\nthat both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had\r\nwritten in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been\r\nthis morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.\r\nAll this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back\r\nto business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised\r\ndescription of Mr. Hosmer Angel?\"\r\n\r\nI held the little printed slip to the light.\r\n\r\n\"Missing,\" it said, \"on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman\r\nnamed Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height;\r\nstrongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in\r\nthe centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted\r\nglasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen,\r\nin black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert\r\nchain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over\r\nelastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in\r\nLeadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do,\" said Holmes. \"As to the letters,\" he continued,\r\nglancing over them, \"they are very commonplace. Absolutely no\r\nclue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There\r\nis one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are typewritten,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the\r\nneat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you\r\nsee, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is\r\nrather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in\r\nfact, we may call it conclusive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it\r\nbears upon the case?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able\r\nto deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were\r\ninstituted.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters,\r\nwhich should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the\r\nother is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking\r\nhim whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow\r\nevening. It is just as well that we should do business with the\r\nmale relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the\r\nanswers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem\r\nupon the shelf for the interim.\"\r\n\r\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers\r\nof reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that\r\nhe must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy\r\ndemeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had\r\nbeen called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in\r\nthe case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler\r\nphotograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the\r\nSign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with\r\nthe Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle\r\nindeed which he could not unravel.\r\n\r\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\r\nconviction that when I came again on the next evening I would\r\nfind that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up\r\nto the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary\r\nSutherland.\r\n\r\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own\r\nattention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at\r\nthe bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six\r\no'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a\r\nhansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too\r\nlate to assist at the d\u00e9nouement of the little mystery. I found\r\nSherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin\r\nform curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable\r\narray of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell\r\nof hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the\r\nchemical work which was so dear to him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, have you solved it?\" I asked as I entered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, the mystery!\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.\r\nThere was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said\r\nyesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback\r\nis that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss\r\nSutherland?\"\r\n\r\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet\r\nopened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the\r\npassage and a tap at the door.\r\n\r\n\"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,\" said\r\nHolmes. \"He has written to me to say that he would be here at\r\nsix. Come in!\"\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some\r\nthirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a\r\nbland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and\r\npenetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of\r\nus, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a\r\nslight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\r\n\r\n\"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,\" said Holmes. \"I think that\r\nthis typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an\r\nappointment with me for six o'clock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not\r\nquite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland\r\nhas troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far\r\nbetter not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite\r\nagainst my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable,\r\nimpulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily\r\ncontrolled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I\r\ndid not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the\r\nofficial police, but it is not pleasant to have a family\r\nmisfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless\r\nexpense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" said Holmes quietly; \"I have every reason to\r\nbelieve that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. \"I am\r\ndelighted to hear it,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It is a curious thing,\" remarked Holmes, \"that a typewriter has\r\nreally quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless\r\nthey are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some\r\nletters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one\r\nside. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that\r\nin every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and\r\na slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other\r\ncharacteristics, but those are the more obvious.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office,\r\nand no doubt it is a little worn,\" our visitor answered, glancing\r\nkeenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.\r\n\r\n\"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,\r\nMr. Windibank,\" Holmes continued. \"I think of writing another\r\nlittle monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its\r\nrelation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some\r\nlittle attention. I have here four letters which purport to come\r\nfrom the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not\r\nonly are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will\r\nobserve, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen\r\nother characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. \"I\r\ncannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\"\r\nhe said. \"If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know\r\nwhen you have done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in\r\nthe door. \"I let you know, then, that I have caught him!\"\r\n\r\n\"What! where?\" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips\r\nand glancing about him like a rat in a trap.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it won't do--really it won't,\" said Holmes suavely. \"There\r\nis no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too\r\ntransparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that\r\nit was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's\r\nright! Sit down and let us talk it over.\"\r\n\r\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a\r\nglitter of moisture on his brow. \"It--it's not actionable,\" he\r\nstammered.\r\n\r\n\"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,\r\nWindibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a\r\npetty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the\r\ncourse of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\"\r\n\r\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his\r\nbreast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up\r\non the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands\r\nin his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed,\r\nthan to us.\r\n\r\n\"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her\r\nmoney,\" said he, \"and he enjoyed the use of the money of the\r\ndaughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable\r\nsum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have\r\nmade a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it.\r\nThe daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate\r\nand warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with\r\nher fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would\r\nnot be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would\r\nmean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her\r\nstepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of\r\nkeeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of\r\npeople of her own age. But soon he found that that would not\r\nanswer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and\r\nfinally announced her positive intention of going to a certain\r\nball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an\r\nidea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the\r\nconnivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself,\r\ncovered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with\r\na moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice\r\ninto an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the\r\ngirl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off\r\nother lovers by making love himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was only a joke at first,\" groaned our visitor. \"We never\r\nthought that she would have been so carried away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very\r\ndecidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that\r\nher stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never\r\nfor an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the\r\ngentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the\r\nloudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began\r\nto call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as\r\nfar as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There\r\nwere meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the\r\ngirl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the\r\ndeception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys\r\nto France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to\r\nbring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it\r\nwould leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and\r\nprevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to\r\ncome. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and\r\nhence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening\r\non the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss\r\nSutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to\r\nhis fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not\r\nlisten to another man. As far as the church door he brought her,\r\nand then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished\r\naway by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a\r\nfour-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of\r\nevents, Mr. Windibank!\"\r\n\r\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes\r\nhad been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold\r\nsneer upon his pale face.\r\n\r\n\"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,\" said he, \"but if you\r\nare so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is\r\nyou who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing\r\nactionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door\r\nlocked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal\r\nconstraint.\"\r\n\r\n\"The law cannot, as you say, touch you,\" said Holmes, unlocking\r\nand throwing open the door, \"yet there never was a man who\r\ndeserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a\r\nfriend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!\"\r\nhe continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon\r\nthe man's face, \"it is not part of my duties to my client, but\r\nhere's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat\r\nmyself to--\" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he\r\ncould grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,\r\nthe heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr.\r\nJames Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\r\n\r\n\"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!\" said Holmes, laughing, as he\r\nthrew himself down into his chair once more. \"That fellow will\r\nrise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and\r\nends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not\r\nentirely devoid of interest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\" I\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.\r\nHosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious\r\nconduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really\r\nprofited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the\r\nstepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together,\r\nbut that the one always appeared when the other was away, was\r\nsuggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice,\r\nwhich both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My\r\nsuspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in\r\ntypewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his\r\nhandwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even\r\nthe smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,\r\ntogether with many minor ones, all pointed in the same\r\ndirection.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how did you verify them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I\r\nknew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed\r\ndescription. I eliminated everything from it which could be the\r\nresult of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I\r\nsent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me\r\nwhether it answered to the description of any of their\r\ntravellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the\r\ntypewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business\r\naddress asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his\r\nreply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but\r\ncharacteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from\r\nWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the\r\ndescription tallied in every respect with that of their employ\u00e9,\r\nJames Windibank. Voil\u00e0 tout!\"\r\n\r\n\"And Miss Sutherland?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old\r\nPersian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger\r\ncub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.'\r\nThere is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much\r\nknowledge of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY\r\n\r\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the\r\nmaid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran\r\nin this way:\r\n\r\n\"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from\r\nthe west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy.\r\nShall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect.\r\nLeave Paddington by the 11:15.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, dear?\" said my wife, looking across at me.\r\n\"Will you go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking\r\na little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good,\r\nand you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained\r\nthrough one of them,\" I answered. \"But if I am to go, I must pack\r\nat once, for I have only half an hour.\"\r\n\r\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the\r\neffect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were\r\nfew and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a\r\ncab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock\r\nHolmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt\r\nfigure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey\r\ntravelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\r\n\r\n\"It is really very good of you to come, Watson,\" said he. \"It\r\nmakes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on\r\nwhom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless\r\nor else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall\r\nget the tickets.\"\r\n\r\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of\r\npapers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged\r\nand read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until\r\nwe were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a\r\ngigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard anything of the case?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.\"\r\n\r\n\"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just\r\nbeen looking through all the recent papers in order to master the\r\nparticulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those\r\nsimple cases which are so extremely difficult.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds a little paradoxical.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a\r\nclue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more\r\ndifficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they\r\nhave established a very serious case against the son of the\r\nmurdered man.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a murder, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for\r\ngranted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into\r\nit. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have\r\nbeen able to understand it, in a very few words.\r\n\r\n\"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\r\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a\r\nMr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned\r\nsome years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he\r\nheld, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was\r\nalso an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the\r\ncolonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to\r\nsettle down they should do so as near each other as possible.\r\nTurner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his\r\ntenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect\r\nequality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son,\r\na lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same\r\nage, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have\r\navoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to\r\nhave led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of\r\nsport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the\r\nneighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl.\r\nTurner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the\r\nleast. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the\r\nfamilies. Now for the facts.\r\n\r\n\"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at\r\nHatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the\r\nBoscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out\r\nof the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been\r\nout with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told\r\nthe man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of\r\nimportance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came\r\nback alive.\r\n\r\n\"From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a\r\nmile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One\r\nwas an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was\r\nWilliam Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both\r\nthese witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The\r\ngame-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.\r\nMcCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the\r\nsame way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the\r\nfather was actually in sight at the time, and the son was\r\nfollowing him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in\r\nthe evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\r\n\r\n\"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder,\r\nthe game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly\r\nwooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the\r\nedge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of\r\nthe lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the\r\nwoods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she\r\nsaw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr.\r\nMcCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a\r\nviolent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very\r\nstrong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his\r\nhand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their\r\nviolence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached\r\nhome that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near\r\nBoscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to\r\nfight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came\r\nrunning up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead\r\nin the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was\r\nmuch excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right\r\nhand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On\r\nfollowing him they found the dead body stretched out upon the\r\ngrass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated\r\nblows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as\r\nmight very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's\r\ngun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the\r\nbody. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly\r\narrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned\r\nat the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the\r\nmagistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next\r\nAssizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out\r\nbefore the coroner and the police-court.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could hardly imagine a more damning case,\" I remarked. \"If\r\never circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\" answered Holmes\r\nthoughtfully. \"It may seem to point very straight to one thing,\r\nbut if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it\r\npointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something\r\nentirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case\r\nlooks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very\r\npossible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people\r\nin the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the\r\ndaughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his\r\ninnocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect\r\nin connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in\r\nhis interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the\r\ncase to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are\r\nflying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly\r\ndigesting their breakfasts at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid,\" said I, \"that the facts are so obvious that you\r\nwill find little credit to be gained out of this case.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\" he\r\nanswered, laughing. \"Besides, we may chance to hit upon some\r\nother obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to\r\nMr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting\r\nwhen I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by\r\nmeans which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of\r\nunderstanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly\r\nperceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand\r\nside, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted\r\neven so self-evident a thing as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"How on earth--\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness\r\nwhich characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this\r\nseason you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less\r\nand less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until\r\nit becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the\r\njaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated\r\nthan the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking\r\nat himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a\r\nresult. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and\r\ninference. Therein lies my m\u00e9tier, and it is just possible that\r\nit may be of some service in the investigation which lies before\r\nus. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in\r\nthe inquest, and which are worth considering.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after\r\nthe return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary\r\ninforming him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not\r\nsurprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.\r\nThis observation of his had the natural effect of removing any\r\ntraces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the\r\ncoroner's jury.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a confession,\" I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at\r\nleast a most suspicious remark.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" said Holmes, \"it is the brightest rift which I\r\ncan at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be,\r\nhe could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the\r\ncircumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared\r\nsurprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I\r\nshould have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such\r\nsurprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,\r\nand yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His\r\nfrank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent\r\nman, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and\r\nfirmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not\r\nunnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of\r\nhis father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day\r\nso far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and\r\neven, according to the little girl whose evidence is so\r\nimportant, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The\r\nself-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark\r\nappear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a\r\nguilty one.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head. \"Many men have been hanged on far slighter\r\nevidence,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the young man's own account of the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters,\r\nthough there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.\r\nYou will find it here, and may read it for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire\r\npaper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the\r\nparagraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own\r\nstatement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the\r\ncorner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this\r\nway:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called\r\nand gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for\r\nthree days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the\r\nmorning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at\r\nthe time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he\r\nhad driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after\r\nmy return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and,\r\nlooking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out\r\nof the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was\r\ngoing. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of\r\nthe Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit\r\nwarren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William\r\nCrowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but\r\nhe is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had\r\nno idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards\r\nfrom the pool I heard a cry of \"Cooee!\" which was a usual signal\r\nbetween my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found\r\nhim standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at\r\nseeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A\r\nconversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows,\r\nfor my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his\r\npassion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned\r\ntowards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,\r\nhowever, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me\r\nto run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground,\r\nwith his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in\r\nmy arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for\r\nsome minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper,\r\nhis house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one\r\nnear my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by\r\nhis injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and\r\nforbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no\r\nactive enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before\r\nhe died?\r\n\r\n\"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some\r\nallusion to a rat.\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\r\n\r\n\"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was\r\ndelirious.\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father\r\nhad this final quarrel?\r\n\r\n\"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\r\n\r\n\"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can\r\nassure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point\r\nout to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case\r\nconsiderably in any future proceedings which may arise.\r\n\r\n\"Witness: I must still refuse.\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common\r\nsignal between you and your father?\r\n\r\n\"Witness: It was.\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw\r\nyou, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\r\n\r\n\"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\r\n\r\n\"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions\r\nwhen you returned on hearing the cry and found your father\r\nfatally injured?\r\n\r\n\"Witness: Nothing definite.\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: What do you mean?\r\n\r\n\"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into\r\nthe open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet\r\nI have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay\r\nupon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be\r\nsomething grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps.\r\nWhen I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, it was gone.'\r\n\r\n\"'You cannot say what it was?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, I had a feeling something was there.'\r\n\r\n\"'How far from the body?'\r\n\r\n\"'A dozen yards or so.'\r\n\r\n\"'And how far from the edge of the wood?'\r\n\r\n\"'About the same.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen\r\nyards of it?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, but with my back towards it.'\r\n\r\n\"This concluded the examination of the witness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said I as I glanced down the column, \"that the coroner\r\nin his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy.\r\nHe calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his\r\nfather having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his\r\nrefusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and\r\nhis singular account of his father's dying words. They are all,\r\nas he remarks, very much against the son.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon\r\nthe cushioned seat. \"Both you and the coroner have been at some\r\npains,\" said he, \"to single out the very strongest points in the\r\nyoung man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him\r\ncredit for having too much imagination and too little? Too\r\nlittle, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would\r\ngive him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from\r\nhis own inner consciousness anything so outr\u00e9 as a dying\r\nreference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No,\r\nsir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what\r\nthis young man says is true, and we shall see whither that\r\nhypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and\r\nnot another word shall I say of this case until we are on the\r\nscene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be\r\nthere in twenty minutes.\"\r\n\r\nIt was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through\r\nthe beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,\r\nfound ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A\r\nlean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for\r\nus upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and\r\nleather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic\r\nsurroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of\r\nScotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a\r\nroom had already been engaged for us.\r\n\r\n\"I have ordered a carriage,\" said Lestrade as we sat over a cup\r\nof tea. \"I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be\r\nhappy until you had been on the scene of the crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was very nice and complimentary of you,\" Holmes answered. \"It\r\nis entirely a question of barometric pressure.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade looked startled. \"I do not quite follow,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud\r\nin the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need\r\nsmoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country\r\nhotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I\r\nshall use the carriage to-night.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade laughed indulgently. \"You have, no doubt, already formed\r\nyour conclusions from the newspapers,\" he said. \"The case is as\r\nplain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer\r\nit becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a\r\nvery positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your\r\nopinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing\r\nwhich you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my\r\nsoul! here is her carriage at the door.\"\r\n\r\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the\r\nmost lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her\r\nviolet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her\r\ncheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her\r\noverpowering excitement and concern.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\" she cried, glancing from one to the\r\nother of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition,\r\nfastening upon my companion, \"I am so glad that you have come. I\r\nhave driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it.\r\nI know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it,\r\ntoo. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each\r\nother since we were little children, and I know his faults as no\r\none else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a\r\ncharge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\" said Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\"You may rely upon my doing all that I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion?\r\nDo you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself\r\nthink that he is innocent?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that it is very probable.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, now!\" she cried, throwing back her head and looking\r\ndefiantly at Lestrade. \"You hear! He gives me hopes.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \"I am afraid that my colleague\r\nhas been a little quick in forming his conclusions,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did\r\nit. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the\r\nreason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because\r\nI was concerned in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what way?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had\r\nmany disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that\r\nthere should be a marriage between us. James and I have always\r\nloved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young\r\nand has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he\r\nnaturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there\r\nwere quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your father?\" asked Holmes. \"Was he in favour of such a\r\nunion?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in\r\nfavour of it.\" A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as\r\nHolmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for this information,\" said he. \"May I see your father\r\nif I call to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for\r\nyears back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken\r\nto his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his\r\nnervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive\r\nwho had known dad in the old days in Victoria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! In Victoria! That is important.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, at the mines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner\r\nmade his money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you\r\nwill go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do\r\ntell him that I know him to be innocent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, Miss Turner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if\r\nI leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\" She\r\nhurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we\r\nheard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\r\n\r\n\"I am ashamed of you, Holmes,\" said Lestrade with dignity after a\r\nfew minutes' silence. \"Why should you raise up hopes which you\r\nare bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I\r\ncall it cruel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\" said\r\nHolmes. \"Have you an order to see him in prison?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but only for you and me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have\r\nstill time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ample.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very\r\nslow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.\"\r\n\r\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through\r\nthe streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel,\r\nwhere I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a\r\nyellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin,\r\nhowever, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were\r\ngroping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the\r\naction to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and\r\ngave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the\r\nday. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were\r\nabsolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely\r\nunforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between\r\nthe time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,\r\ndrawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was\r\nsomething terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the\r\nnature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?\r\nI rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which\r\ncontained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's\r\ndeposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left\r\nparietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been\r\nshattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot\r\nupon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from\r\nbehind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when\r\nseen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it\r\ndid not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his\r\nback before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call\r\nHolmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying\r\nreference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be\r\ndelirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become\r\ndelirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how\r\nhe met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my\r\nbrains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident\r\nof the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the\r\nmurderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his\r\novercoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to\r\nreturn and to carry it away at the instant when the son was\r\nkneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a\r\ntissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I\r\ndid not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith\r\nin Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long\r\nas every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young\r\nMcCarthy's innocence.\r\n\r\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone,\r\nfor Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\r\n\r\n\"The glass still keeps very high,\" he remarked as he sat down.\r\n\"It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able\r\nto go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his\r\nvery best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not\r\nwish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young\r\nMcCarthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did you learn from him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could he throw no light?\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew\r\nwho had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced\r\nnow that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very\r\nquick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think,\r\nsound at heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot admire his taste,\" I remarked, \"if it is indeed a fact\r\nthat he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as\r\nthis Miss Turner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,\r\ninsanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was\r\nonly a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away\r\nfive years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get\r\ninto the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a\r\nregistry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can\r\nimagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not\r\ndoing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows\r\nto be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort\r\nwhich made him throw his hands up into the air when his father,\r\nat their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss\r\nTurner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself,\r\nand his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would\r\nhave thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with\r\nhis barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in\r\nBristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that\r\npoint. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however,\r\nfor the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious\r\ntrouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and\r\nhas written to him to say that she has a husband already in the\r\nBermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I\r\nthink that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all\r\nthat he has suffered.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if he is innocent, who has done it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two\r\npoints. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with\r\nsomeone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his\r\nson, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would\r\nreturn. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry\r\n'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the\r\ncrucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk\r\nabout George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all\r\nminor matters until to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke\r\nbright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with\r\nthe carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe\r\nPool.\r\n\r\n\"There is serious news this morning,\" Lestrade observed. \"It is\r\nsaid that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is\r\ndespaired of.\"\r\n\r\n\"An elderly man, I presume?\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life\r\nabroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This\r\nbusiness has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend\r\nof McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I\r\nhave learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! That is interesting,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody\r\nabout here speaks of his kindness to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this\r\nMcCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have\r\nbeen under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of\r\nmarrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably,\r\nheiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner,\r\nas if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would\r\nfollow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself\r\nwas averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not\r\ndeduce something from that?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have got to the deductions and the inferences,\" said\r\nLestrade, winking at me. \"I find it hard enough to tackle facts,\r\nHolmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said Holmes demurely; \"you do find it very hard\r\nto tackle the facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it\r\ndifficult to get hold of,\" replied Lestrade with some warmth.\r\n\r\n\"And that is--\"\r\n\r\n\"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that\r\nall theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\" said Holmes,\r\nlaughing. \"But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley\r\nFarm upon the left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is it.\" It was a widespread, comfortable-looking\r\nbuilding, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches\r\nof lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless\r\nchimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight\r\nof this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door,\r\nwhen the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her\r\nmaster wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the\r\nson's, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured\r\nthese very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes\r\ndesired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed\r\nthe winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent\r\nas this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of\r\nBaker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed\r\nand darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines,\r\nwhile his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.\r\nHis face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips\r\ncompressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,\r\nsinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal\r\nlust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated\r\nupon the matter before him that a question or remark fell\r\nunheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,\r\nimpatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way\r\nalong the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of\r\nthe woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is\r\nall that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon\r\nthe path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either\r\nside. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and\r\nonce he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and\r\nI walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous,\r\nwhile I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the\r\nconviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a\r\ndefinite end.\r\n\r\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water\r\nsome fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the\r\nHatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.\r\nAbove the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see\r\nthe red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich\r\nlandowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods\r\ngrew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass\r\ntwenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds\r\nwhich lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which\r\nthe body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,\r\nthat I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the\r\nfall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager\r\nface and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read\r\nupon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking\r\nup a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\r\n\r\n\"What did you go into the pool for?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon\r\nor other trace. But how on earth--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its\r\ninward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and\r\nthere it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all\r\nhave been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo\r\nand wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the\r\nlodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or\r\neight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of\r\nthe same feet.\" He drew out a lens and lay down upon his\r\nwaterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to\r\nhimself than to us. \"These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he\r\nwas walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are\r\ndeeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his\r\nstory. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are\r\nthe father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It\r\nis the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this?\r\nHa, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite\r\nunusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course\r\nthat was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?\" He ran up\r\nand down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we\r\nwere well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a\r\ngreat beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced\r\nhis way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon\r\nhis face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he\r\nremained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,\r\ngathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and\r\nexamining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of\r\nthe tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among\r\nthe moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then\r\nhe followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the\r\nhighroad, where all traces were lost.\r\n\r\n\"It has been a case of considerable interest,\" he remarked,\r\nreturning to his natural manner. \"I fancy that this grey house on\r\nthe right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a\r\nword with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done\r\nthat, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab,\r\nand I shall be with you presently.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove\r\nback into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he\r\nhad picked up in the wood.\r\n\r\n\"This may interest you, Lestrade,\" he remarked, holding it out.\r\n\"The murder was done with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no marks.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are none.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few\r\ndays. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It\r\ncorresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other\r\nweapon.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the murderer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears\r\nthick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian\r\ncigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his\r\npocket. There are several other indications, but these may be\r\nenough to aid us in our search.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade laughed. \"I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a\r\nhard-headed British jury.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nous verrons,\" answered Holmes calmly. \"You work your own\r\nmethod, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon,\r\nand shall probably return to London by the evening train.\"\r\n\r\n\"And leave your case unfinished?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, finished.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the mystery?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is solved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was the criminal, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman I describe.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a\r\npopulous neighbourhood.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \"I am a practical man,\" he said,\r\n\"and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking\r\nfor a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the\r\nlaughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Holmes quietly. \"I have given you the chance.\r\nHere are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before\r\nI leave.\"\r\n\r\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where\r\nwe found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in\r\nthought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds\r\nhimself in a perplexing position.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Watson,\" he said when the cloth was cleared \"just sit\r\ndown in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't\r\nknow quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a\r\ncigar and let me expound.\"\r\n\r\n \"Pray do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about\r\nyoung McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly,\r\nalthough they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One\r\nwas the fact that his father should, according to his account,\r\ncry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying\r\nreference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but\r\nthat was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double\r\npoint our research must commence, and we will begin it by\r\npresuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of this 'Cooee!' then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The\r\nson, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that\r\nhe was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the\r\nattention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But\r\n'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used\r\nbetween Australians. There is a strong presumption that the\r\nperson whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was\r\nsomeone who had been in Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of the rat, then?\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened\r\nit out on the table. \"This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\"\r\nhe said. \"I wired to Bristol for it last night.\" He put his hand\r\nover part of the map. \"What do you read?\"\r\n\r\n\"ARAT,\" I read.\r\n\r\n\"And now?\" He raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\"BALLARAT.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his\r\nson only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter\r\nthe name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is wonderful!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down\r\nconsiderably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point\r\nwhich, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a\r\ncertainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite\r\nconception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only\r\nbe approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could\r\nhardly wander.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the\r\nground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that\r\nimbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did you gain them?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of\r\ntrifles.\"\r\n\r\n\"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length\r\nof his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they were peculiar boots.\"\r\n\r\n\"But his lameness?\"\r\n\r\n\"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than\r\nhis left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he\r\nwas lame.\"\r\n\r\n\"But his left-handedness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded\r\nby the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from\r\nimmediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can\r\nthat be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind\r\nthat tree during the interview between the father and son. He had\r\neven smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special\r\nknowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian\r\ncigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and\r\nwritten a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different\r\nvarieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the\r\nash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss\r\nwhere he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety\r\nwhich are rolled in Rotterdam.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the cigar-holder?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he\r\nused a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the\r\ncut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holmes,\" I said, \"you have drawn a net round this man from which\r\nhe cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as\r\ntruly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the\r\ndirection in which all this points. The culprit is--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. John Turner,\" cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of\r\nour sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His\r\nslow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of\r\ndecrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and\r\nhis enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual\r\nstrength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled\r\nhair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air\r\nof dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an\r\nashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were\r\ntinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that\r\nhe was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\r\n\r\n\"Pray sit down on the sofa,\" said Holmes gently. \"You had my\r\nnote?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to\r\nsee me here to avoid scandal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why did you wish to see me?\" He looked across at my\r\ncompanion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question\r\nwas already answered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. \"It\r\nis so. I know all about McCarthy.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. \"God help me!\" he cried.\r\n\"But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you\r\nmy word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at\r\nthe Assizes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear you say so,\" said Holmes gravely.\r\n\r\n\"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It\r\nwould break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears\r\nthat I am arrested.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may not come to that,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter\r\nwho required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.\r\nYoung McCarthy must be got off, however.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a dying man,\" said old Turner. \"I have had diabetes for\r\nyears. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a\r\nmonth. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand\r\nand a bundle of paper before him. \"Just tell us the truth,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson\r\nhere can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the\r\nlast extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall\r\nnot use it unless it is absolutely needed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's as well,\" said the old man; \"it's a question whether I\r\nshall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I\r\nshould wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the\r\nthing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but\r\nwill not take me long to tell.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil\r\nincarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of\r\nsuch a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years,\r\nand he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be\r\nin his power.\r\n\r\n\"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap\r\nthen, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at\r\nanything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck\r\nwith my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you\r\nwould call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and\r\nwe had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time\r\nto time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.\r\nBlack Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party\r\nis still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\r\n\r\n\"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and\r\nwe lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers\r\nand six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of\r\ntheir saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed,\r\nhowever, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of\r\nthe wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the\r\nLord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his\r\nwicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every\r\nfeature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made\r\nour way over to England without being suspected. There I parted\r\nfrom my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and\r\nrespectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in\r\nthe market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,\r\nto make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too,\r\nand though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.\r\nEven when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down\r\nthe right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned\r\nover a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was\r\ngoing well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\r\n\r\n\"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in\r\nRegent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n\"'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be\r\nas good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and\r\nyou can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine,\r\nlaw-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman\r\nwithin hail.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking\r\nthem off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land\r\never since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness;\r\nturn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my\r\nelbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more\r\nafraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he\r\nwanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without\r\nquestion, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing\r\nwhich I could not give. He asked for Alice.\r\n\r\n\"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was\r\nknown to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that\r\nhis lad should step into the whole property. But there I was\r\nfirm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that\r\nI had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that\r\nwas enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do\r\nhis worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses\r\nto talk it over.\r\n\r\n\"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I\r\nsmoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.\r\nBut as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in\r\nme seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my\r\ndaughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she\r\nwere a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I\r\nand all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a\r\nman as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and\r\na desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb,\r\nI knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl!\r\nBoth could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I\r\ndid it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned,\r\nI have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl\r\nshould be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more\r\nthan I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction\r\nthan if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought\r\nback his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I\r\nwas forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in\r\nmy flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that\r\noccurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is not for me to judge you,\" said Holmes as the old man\r\nsigned the statement which had been drawn out. \"I pray that we\r\nmay never be exposed to such a temptation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you\r\nwill soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the\r\nAssizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is\r\ncondemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be\r\nseen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or\r\ndead, shall be safe with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, then,\" said the old man solemnly. \"Your own deathbeds,\r\nwhen they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace\r\nwhich you have given to mine.\" Tottering and shaking in all his\r\ngiant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.\r\n\r\n\"God help us!\" said Holmes after a long silence. \"Why does fate\r\nplay such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such\r\na case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say,\r\n'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.'\"\r\n\r\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a\r\nnumber of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and\r\nsubmitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven\r\nmonths after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is\r\nevery prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily\r\ntogether in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS\r\n\r\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes\r\ncases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which\r\npresent strange and interesting features that it is no easy\r\nmatter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however,\r\nhave already gained publicity through the papers, and others have\r\nnot offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend\r\npossessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of\r\nthese papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his\r\nanalytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without\r\nan ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and\r\nhave their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and\r\nsurmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to\r\nhim. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable\r\nin its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted\r\nto give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are\r\npoints in connection with it which never have been, and probably\r\nnever will be, entirely cleared up.\r\n\r\nThe year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater\r\nor less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my\r\nheadings under this one twelve months I find an account of the\r\nadventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant\r\nSociety, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a\r\nfurniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the\r\nBritish barque \"Sophy Anderson\", of the singular adventures of the\r\nGrice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the\r\nCamberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered,\r\nSherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to\r\nprove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that\r\ntherefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a\r\ndeduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the\r\ncase. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of\r\nthem present such singular features as the strange train of\r\ncircumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.\r\n\r\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales\r\nhad set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had\r\nscreamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that\r\neven here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced\r\nto raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and\r\nto recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which\r\nshriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like\r\nuntamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew\r\nhigher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in\r\nthe chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the\r\nfireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the\r\nother was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until\r\nthe howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text,\r\nand the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of\r\nthe sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a\r\nfew days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said I, glancing up at my companion, \"that was surely the\r\nbell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"Except yourself I have none,\" he answered. \"I do not encourage\r\nvisitors.\"\r\n\r\n\"A client, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out\r\non such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more\r\nlikely to be some crony of the landlady's.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there\r\ncame a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He\r\nstretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and\r\ntowards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\r\n\r\n\"Come in!\" said he.\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the\r\noutside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of\r\nrefinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella\r\nwhich he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told\r\nof the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about\r\nhim anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his\r\nface was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is\r\nweighed down with some great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"I owe you an apology,\" he said, raising his golden pince-nez to\r\nhis eyes. \"I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have\r\nbrought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug\r\nchamber.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me your coat and umbrella,\" said Holmes. \"They may rest\r\nhere on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from\r\nthe south-west, I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, from Horsham.\"\r\n\r\n\"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is\r\nquite distinctive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have come for advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is easily got.\"\r\n\r\n\"And help.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not always so easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast\r\nhow you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\"\r\n\r\n\"He said that you could solve anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"He said too much.\"\r\n\r\n\"That you are never beaten.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true that I have been generally successful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you may be so with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me\r\nwith some details as to your case.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no ordinary one.\"\r\n\r\n\"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of\r\nappeal.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you\r\nhave ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of\r\nevents than those which have happened in my own family.\"\r\n\r\n\"You fill me with interest,\" said Holmes. \"Pray give us the\r\nessential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards\r\nquestion you as to those details which seem to me to be most\r\nimportant.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out\r\ntowards the blaze.\r\n\r\n\"My name,\" said he, \"is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have,\r\nas far as I can understand, little to do with this awful\r\nbusiness. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an\r\nidea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the\r\naffair.\r\n\r\n\"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias\r\nand my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry,\r\nwhich he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He\r\nwas a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business\r\nmet with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire\r\nupon a handsome competence.\r\n\r\n\"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and\r\nbecame a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done\r\nvery well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army,\r\nand afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When\r\nLee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where\r\nhe remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came\r\nback to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham.\r\nHe had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his\r\nreason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his\r\ndislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to\r\nthem. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very\r\nfoul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring\r\ndisposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I\r\ndoubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or\r\nthree fields round his house, and there he would take his\r\nexercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave\r\nhis room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very\r\nheavily, but he would see no society and did not want any\r\nfriends, not even his own brother.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the\r\ntime when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This\r\nwould be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years\r\nin England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he\r\nwas very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be\r\nfond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would\r\nmake me his representative both with the servants and with the\r\ntradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite\r\nmaster of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I\r\nliked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in\r\nhis privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he\r\nhad a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was\r\ninvariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or\r\nanyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped\r\nthrough the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a\r\ncollection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such\r\na room.\r\n\r\n\"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp\r\nlay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a\r\ncommon thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all\r\npaid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From\r\nIndia!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can\r\nthis be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little\r\ndried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to\r\nlaugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight\r\nof his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his\r\nskin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he\r\nstill held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and\r\nthen, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'\r\n\r\n\"'What is it, uncle?' I cried.\r\n\r\n\"'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his\r\nroom, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope\r\nand saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the\r\ngum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else\r\nsave the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his\r\noverpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I\r\nascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key,\r\nwhich must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small\r\nbrass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\r\n\r\n\"'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,'\r\nsaid he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my\r\nroom to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'\r\n\r\n\"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to\r\nstep up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the\r\ngrate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned\r\npaper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I\r\nglanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was\r\nprinted the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\n\"'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave\r\nmy estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to\r\nmy brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to\r\nyou. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you\r\ncannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest\r\nenemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't\r\nsay what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper\r\nwhere Mr. Fordham shows you.'\r\n\r\n\"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with\r\nhim. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest\r\nimpression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every\r\nway in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I\r\ncould not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left\r\nbehind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed\r\nand nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I\r\ncould see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever,\r\nand he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his\r\ntime he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the\r\ninside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy\r\nand would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a\r\nrevolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man,\r\nand that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by\r\nman or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would\r\nrush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him,\r\nlike a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror\r\nwhich lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen\r\nhis face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it\r\nwere new raised from a basin.\r\n\r\n\"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to\r\nabuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those\r\ndrunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when\r\nwe went to search for him, face downward in a little\r\ngreen-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There\r\nwas no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep,\r\nso that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity,\r\nbrought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced\r\nfrom the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself\r\nthat he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,\r\nhowever, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and\r\nof some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment,\" Holmes interposed, \"your statement is, I foresee,\r\none of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me\r\nhave the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and\r\nthe date of his supposed suicide.\"\r\n\r\n\"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks\r\nlater, upon the night of May 2nd.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. Pray proceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my\r\nrequest, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been\r\nalways locked up. We found the brass box there, although its\r\ncontents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a\r\npaper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and\r\n'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath.\r\nThese, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had\r\nbeen destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was\r\nnothing of much importance in the attic save a great many\r\nscattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in\r\nAmerica. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had\r\ndone his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.\r\nOthers were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern\r\nstates, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had\r\nevidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag\r\npoliticians who had been sent down from the North.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at\r\nHorsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the\r\nJanuary of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my\r\nfather give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the\r\nbreakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened\r\nenvelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the\r\noutstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what\r\nhe called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked\r\nvery scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.\r\n\r\n\"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are\r\nthe very letters. But what is this written above them?'\r\n\r\n\"'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.\r\n\r\n\"'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the\r\npapers must be those that are destroyed.'\r\n\r\n\"'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a\r\ncivilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind.\r\nWhere does the thing come from?'\r\n\r\n\"'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.\r\n\r\n\"'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do\r\nwith sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such\r\nnonsense.'\r\n\r\n\"'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then let me do so?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such\r\nnonsense.'\r\n\r\n\"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate\r\nman. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of\r\nforebodings.\r\n\r\n\"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went\r\nfrom home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is\r\nin command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad\r\nthat he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from\r\ndanger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in\r\nerror. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram\r\nfrom the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had\r\nfallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the\r\nneighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I\r\nhurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered\r\nhis consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from\r\nFareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him,\r\nand the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in\r\nbringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.'\r\nCarefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I\r\nwas unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of\r\nmurder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no\r\nrobbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.\r\nAnd yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease,\r\nand that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been\r\nwoven round him.\r\n\r\n\"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me\r\nwhy I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well\r\nconvinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an\r\nincident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as\r\npressing in one house as in another.\r\n\r\n\"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two\r\nyears and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time\r\nI have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that\r\nthis curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended\r\nwith the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon,\r\nhowever; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in\r\nwhich it had come upon my father.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and\r\nturning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried\r\norange pips.\r\n\r\n\"This is the envelope,\" he continued. \"The postmark is\r\nLondon--eastern division. Within are the very words which were\r\nupon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the\r\npapers on the sundial.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you done?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"To tell the truth\"--he sank his face into his thin, white\r\nhands--\"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor\r\nrabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in\r\nthe grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight\r\nand no precautions can guard against.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut! tut!\" cried Sherlock Holmes. \"You must act, man, or you are\r\nlost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for\r\ndespair.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have seen the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that\r\nthe inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all\r\npractical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really\r\naccidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with\r\nthe warnings.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \"Incredible\r\nimbecility!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in\r\nthe house with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has he come with you to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. His orders were to stay in the house.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you come to me,\" he cried, \"and, above all, why did you\r\nnot come at once?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major\r\nPrendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have\r\nacted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than\r\nthat which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which\r\nmight help us?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing,\" said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat\r\npocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted\r\npaper, he laid it out upon the table. \"I have some remembrance,\"\r\nsaid he, \"that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I\r\nobserved that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the\r\nashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet\r\nupon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it\r\nmay be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from\r\namong the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond\r\nthe mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think\r\nmyself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is\r\nundoubtedly my uncle's.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper,\r\nwhich showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from\r\na book. It was headed, \"March, 1869,\" and beneath were the\r\nfollowing enigmatical notices:\r\n\r\n\"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\r\n\r\n\"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and\r\n      John Swain, of St. Augustine.\r\n\r\n\"9th. McCauley cleared.\r\n\r\n\"10th. John Swain cleared.\r\n\r\n\"12th. Visited Paramore. All well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you!\" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it\r\nto our visitor. \"And now you must on no account lose another\r\ninstant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told\r\nme. You must get home instantly and act.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must\r\nput this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass\r\nbox which you have described. You must also put in a note to say\r\nthat all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that\r\nthis is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such\r\nwords as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you\r\nmust at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do\r\nyou understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Entirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I\r\nthink that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our\r\nweb to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first\r\nconsideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens\r\nyou. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the\r\nguilty parties.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you,\" said the young man, rising and pulling on his\r\novercoat. \"You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall\r\ncertainly do as you advise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in\r\nthe meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that\r\nyou are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you\r\ngo back?\"\r\n\r\n\"By train from Waterloo.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that\r\nyou may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too\r\nclosely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am armed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall see you at Horsham, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news\r\nas to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every\r\nparticular.\" He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside\r\nthe wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered\r\nagainst the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come\r\nto us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet\r\nof sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk\r\nforward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he\r\nlit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue\r\nsmoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"I think, Watson,\" he remarked at last, \"that of all our cases we\r\nhave had none more fantastic than this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems\r\nto me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the\r\nSholtos.\"\r\n\r\n\"But have you,\" I asked, \"formed any definite conception as to\r\nwhat these perils are?\"\r\n\r\n\"There can be no question as to their nature,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue\r\nthis unhappy family?\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the\r\narms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. \"The ideal\r\nreasoner,\" he remarked, \"would, when he had once been shown a\r\nsingle fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the\r\nchain of events which led up to it but also all the results which\r\nwould follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole\r\nanimal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who\r\nhas thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents\r\nshould be able to accurately state all the other ones, both\r\nbefore and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the\r\nreason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study\r\nwhich have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the\r\naid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest\r\npitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to\r\nutilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this\r\nin itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all\r\nknowledge, which, even in these days of free education and\r\nencyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so\r\nimpossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge\r\nwhich is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have\r\nendeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one\r\noccasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits\r\nin a very precise fashion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered, laughing. \"It was a singular document.\r\nPhilosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I\r\nremember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the\r\nmud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry\r\neccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime\r\nrecords unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and\r\nself-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the\r\nmain points of my analysis.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes grinned at the last item. \"Well,\" he said, \"I say now, as\r\nI said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic\r\nstocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the\r\nrest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he\r\ncan get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which\r\nhas been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster\r\nall our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the\r\n'American Encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside you.\r\nThank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be\r\ndeduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong\r\npresumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for\r\nleaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their\r\nhabits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for\r\nthe lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love\r\nof solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of\r\nsomeone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis\r\nthat it was fear of someone or something which drove him from\r\nAmerica. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by\r\nconsidering the formidable letters which were received by himself\r\nand his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those\r\nletters?\"\r\n\r\n\"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the\r\nthird from London.\"\r\n\r\n\"From East London. What do you deduce from that?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that\r\nthe probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was\r\non board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the\r\ncase of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and\r\nits fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days.\r\nDoes that suggest anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"A greater distance to travel.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the letter had also a greater distance to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I do not see the point.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man\r\nor men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send\r\ntheir singular warning or token before them when starting upon\r\ntheir mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign\r\nwhen it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a\r\nsteamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.\r\nBut, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those\r\nseven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which\r\nbrought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the\r\nwriter.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly\r\nurgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to\r\ncaution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which\r\nit would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one\r\ncomes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" I cried. \"What can it mean, this relentless\r\npersecution?\"\r\n\r\n\"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital\r\nimportance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think\r\nthat it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.\r\nA single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way\r\nas to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in\r\nit, and they must have been men of resource and determination.\r\nTheir papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.\r\nIn this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an\r\nindividual and becomes the badge of a society.\"\r\n\r\n\"But of what society?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you never--\" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and\r\nsinking his voice--\"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never have.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. \"Here it\r\nis,\" said he presently:\r\n\r\n\"'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to\r\nthe sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret\r\nsociety was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the\r\nSouthern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local\r\nbranches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,\r\nLouisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was\r\nused for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of\r\nthe negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country\r\nof those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually\r\npreceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic\r\nbut generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some\r\nparts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this\r\nthe victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might\r\nfly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would\r\nunfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and\r\nunforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the\r\nsociety, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a\r\ncase upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with\r\nimpunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the\r\nperpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite\r\nof the efforts of the United States government and of the better\r\nclasses of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year\r\n1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have\r\nbeen sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'\r\n\r\n\"You will observe,\" said Holmes, laying down the volume, \"that\r\nthe sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the\r\ndisappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may\r\nwell have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his\r\nfamily have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.\r\nYou can understand that this register and diary may implicate\r\nsome of the first men in the South, and that there may be many\r\nwho will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the page we have seen--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent\r\nthe pips to A, B, and C'--that is, sent the society's warning to\r\nthem. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or\r\nleft the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a\r\nsinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let\r\nsome light into this dark place, and I believe that the only\r\nchance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have\r\ntold him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done\r\nto-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for\r\nhalf an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable\r\nways of our fellow-men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a\r\nsubdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the\r\ngreat city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse me for not waiting for you,\" said he; \"I have, I\r\nforesee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of\r\nyoung Openshaw's.\"\r\n\r\n\"What steps will you take?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries.\r\nI may have to go down to Horsham, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not go there first?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the\r\nmaid will bring up your coffee.\"\r\n\r\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and\r\nglanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a\r\nchill to my heart.\r\n\r\n\"Holmes,\" I cried, \"you are too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said he, laying down his cup, \"I feared as much. How was it\r\ndone?\" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\r\n\r\n\"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy\r\nNear Waterloo Bridge.' Here is the account:\r\n\r\n\"Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H\r\nDivision, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and\r\na splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and\r\nstormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it\r\nwas quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was\r\ngiven, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was\r\neventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman\r\nwhose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his\r\npocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham.\r\nIt is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch\r\nthe last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and\r\nthe extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge\r\nof one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body\r\nexhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that\r\nthe deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident,\r\nwhich should have the effect of calling the attention of the\r\nauthorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.\"\r\n\r\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and\r\nshaken than I had ever seen him.\r\n\r\n\"That hurts my pride, Watson,\" he said at last. \"It is a petty\r\nfeeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal\r\nmatter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my\r\nhand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that\r\nI should send him away to his death--!\" He sprang from his chair\r\nand paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a\r\nflush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and\r\nunclasping of his long thin hands.\r\n\r\n\"They must be cunning devils,\" he exclaimed at last. \"How could\r\nthey have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the\r\ndirect line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too\r\ncrowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson,\r\nwe shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!\"\r\n\r\n\"To the police?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may\r\ntake the flies, but not before.\"\r\n\r\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in\r\nthe evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes\r\nhad not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he\r\nentered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard,\r\nand tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously,\r\nwashing it down with a long draught of water.\r\n\r\n\"You are hungry,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since\r\nbreakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how have you succeeded?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a clue?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not\r\nlong remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish\r\ntrade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he\r\nsqueezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and\r\nthrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote\r\n\"S. H. for J. O.\" Then he sealed it and addressed it to \"Captain\r\nJames Calhoun, Barque 'Lone Star,' Savannah, Georgia.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will await him when he enters port,\" said he, chuckling.\r\n\"It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a\r\nprecursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is this Captain Calhoun?\"\r\n\r\n\"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you trace it, then?\"\r\n\r\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with\r\ndates and names.\r\n\r\n\"I have spent the whole day,\" said he, \"over Lloyd's registers\r\nand files of the old papers, following the future career of every\r\nvessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in\r\n'83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were\r\nreported there during those months. Of these, one, the 'Lone Star,'\r\ninstantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported\r\nas having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to\r\none of the states of the Union.\"\r\n\r\n\"Texas, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must\r\nhave an American origin.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque\r\n'Lone Star' was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a\r\ncertainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present\r\nin the port of London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"The 'Lone Star' had arrived here last week. I went down to the\r\nAlbert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by\r\nthe early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired\r\nto Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and\r\nas the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the\r\nGoodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I\r\nlearn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are\r\nFinns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away\r\nfrom the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has\r\nbeen loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship\r\nreaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and\r\nthe cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these\r\nthree gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.\"\r\n\r\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans,\r\nand the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the\r\norange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as\r\nresolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very\r\nsevere were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for\r\nnews of the \"Lone Star\" of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We\r\ndid at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a\r\nshattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough\r\nof a wave, with the letters \"L. S.\" carved upon it, and that is\r\nall which we shall ever know of the fate of the \"Lone Star.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP\r\n\r\nIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal\r\nof the Theological College of St. George's, was much addicted to\r\nopium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some\r\nfoolish freak when he was at college; for having read De\r\nQuincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had\r\ndrenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the\r\nsame effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the\r\npractice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many\r\nyears he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of\r\nmingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see\r\nhim now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point\r\npupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble\r\nman.\r\n\r\nOne night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell,\r\nabout the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the\r\nclock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work\r\ndown in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"A patient!\" said she. \"You'll have to go out.\"\r\n\r\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\r\n\r\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps\r\nupon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in\r\nsome dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse my calling so late,\" she began, and then,\r\nsuddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms\r\nabout my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. \"Oh, I'm in\r\nsuch trouble!\" she cried; \"I do so want a little help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said my wife, pulling up her veil, \"it is Kate Whitney.\r\nHow you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when\r\nyou came in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you.\" That was\r\nalways the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds\r\nto a light-house.\r\n\r\n\"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine\r\nand water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or\r\nshould you rather that I sent James off to bed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about\r\nIsa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about\r\nhim!\"\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her\r\nhusband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend\r\nand school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words\r\nas we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it\r\npossible that we could bring him back to her?\r\n\r\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late\r\nhe had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the\r\nfarthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been\r\nconfined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and\r\nshattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him\r\neight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the\r\ndregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the\r\neffects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar\r\nof Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could\r\nshe, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and\r\npluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\r\n\r\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of\r\nit. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second\r\nthought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical\r\nadviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it\r\nbetter if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would\r\nsend him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the\r\naddress which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left\r\nmy armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding\r\neastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at\r\nthe time, though the future only could show how strange it was to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my\r\nadventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the\r\nhigh wharves which line the north side of the river to the east\r\nof London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached\r\nby a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the\r\nmouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search.\r\nOrdering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in\r\nthe centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the\r\nlight of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch\r\nand made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the\r\nbrown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the\r\nforecastle of an emigrant ship.\r\n\r\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying\r\nin strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads\r\nthrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a\r\ndark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black\r\nshadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright,\r\nnow faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of\r\nthe metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to\r\nthemselves, and others talked together in a strange, low,\r\nmonotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then\r\nsuddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own\r\nthoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At\r\nthe farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside\r\nwhich on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old\r\nman, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon\r\nhis knees, staring into the fire.\r\n\r\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe\r\nfor me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. I have not come to stay,\" said I. \"There is a friend\r\nof mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and\r\npeering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and\r\nunkempt, staring out at me.\r\n\r\n\"My God! It's Watson,\" said he. He was in a pitiable state of\r\nreaction, with every nerve in a twitter. \"I say, Watson, what\r\no'clock is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nearly eleven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of Friday, June 19th.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What\r\nd'you want to frighten a chap for?\" He sank his face onto his\r\narms and began to sob in a high treble key.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting\r\nthis two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!\"\r\n\r\n\"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here\r\na few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll\r\ngo home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate.\r\nGive me your hand! Have you a cab?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have one waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I\r\nowe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.\"\r\n\r\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of\r\nsleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying\r\nfumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed\r\nthe tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my\r\nskirt, and a low voice whispered, \"Walk past me, and then look\r\nback at me.\" The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I\r\nglanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my\r\nside, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very\r\nwrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between\r\nhis knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his\r\nfingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my\r\nself-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of\r\nastonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him\r\nbut I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull\r\neyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and\r\ngrinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He\r\nmade a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he\r\nturned his face half round to the company once more, subsided\r\ninto a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\r\n\r\n\"Holmes!\" I whispered, \"what on earth are you doing in this den?\"\r\n\r\n\"As low as you can,\" he answered; \"I have excellent ears. If you\r\nwould have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend\r\nof yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a cab outside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he\r\nappears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should\r\nrecommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to\r\nsay that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait\r\noutside, I shall be with you in five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for\r\nthey were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with\r\nsuch a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney\r\nwas once confined in the cab my mission was practically\r\naccomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better\r\nthan to be associated with my friend in one of those singular\r\nadventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a\r\nfew minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him\r\nout to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a\r\nvery short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den,\r\nand I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two\r\nstreets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.\r\nThen, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and\r\nburst into a hearty fit of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose, Watson,\" said he, \"that you imagine that I have added\r\nopium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little\r\nweaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical\r\nviews.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was certainly surprised to find you there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not more so than I to find you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came to find a friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I to find an enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"An enemy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural\r\nprey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable\r\ninquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent\r\nramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been\r\nrecognised in that den my life would not have been worth an\r\nhour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own\r\npurposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have\r\nvengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that\r\nbuilding, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some\r\nstrange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless\r\nnights.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! You do not mean bodies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds\r\nfor every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It\r\nis the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that\r\nNeville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our\r\ntrap should be here.\" He put his two forefingers between his\r\nteeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a\r\nsimilar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle\r\nof wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Watson,\" said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through\r\nthe gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from\r\nits side lanterns. \"You'll come with me, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I can be of use.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still\r\nmore so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Cedars?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I\r\nconduct the inquiry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is it, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am all in the dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up\r\nhere. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a\r\ncrown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her\r\nhead. So long, then!\"\r\n\r\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through\r\nthe endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which\r\nwidened gradually, until we were flying across a broad\r\nbalustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly\r\nbeneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and\r\nmortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of\r\nthe policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of\r\nrevellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a\r\nstar or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of\r\nthe clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his\r\nbreast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat\r\nbeside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which\r\nseemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in\r\nupon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles,\r\nand were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban\r\nvillas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up\r\nhis pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he\r\nis acting for the best.\r\n\r\n\"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,\" said he. \"It makes\r\nyou quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great\r\nthing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are\r\nnot over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear\r\nlittle woman to-night when she meets me at the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget that I know nothing about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before\r\nwe get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can\r\nget nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I\r\ncan't get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case\r\nclearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a\r\nspark where all is dark to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Proceed, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee\r\na gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have\r\nplenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very\r\nnicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made\r\nfriends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter\r\nof a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no\r\noccupation, but was interested in several companies and went into\r\ntown as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon\r\nStreet every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of\r\nage, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very\r\naffectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know\r\nhim. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far\r\nas we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while\r\nhe has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and\r\nCounties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money\r\ntroubles have been weighing upon his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier\r\nthan usual, remarking before he started that he had two important\r\ncommissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy\r\nhome a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife\r\nreceived a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his\r\ndeparture, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable\r\nvalue which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the\r\noffices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up\r\nin your London, you will know that the office of the company is\r\nin Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where\r\nyou found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for\r\nthe City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office,\r\ngot her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through\r\nSwandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me\r\nso far?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St.\r\nClair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab,\r\nas she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself.\r\nWhile she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly\r\nheard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her\r\nhusband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning\r\nto her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she\r\ndistinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly\r\nagitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then\r\nvanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that\r\nhe had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind.\r\nOne singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that\r\nalthough he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town\r\nin, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\r\n\r\n\"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the\r\nsteps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which\r\nyou found me to-night--and running through the front room she\r\nattempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At\r\nthe foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of\r\nwhom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who\r\nacts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled\r\nwith the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the\r\nlane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of\r\nconstables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The\r\ninspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the\r\ncontinued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to\r\nthe room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no\r\nsign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was\r\nno one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who,\r\nit seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly\r\nswore that no one else had been in the front room during the\r\nafternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was\r\nstaggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had\r\nbeen deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box\r\nwhich lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell\r\na cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which he had\r\npromised to bring home.\r\n\r\n\"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple\r\nshowed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious.\r\nThe rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an\r\nabominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a\r\nsitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon\r\nthe back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom\r\nwindow is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered\r\nat high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The\r\nbedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On\r\nexamination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill,\r\nand several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of\r\nthe bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were\r\nall the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of\r\nhis coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were\r\nthere. There were no signs of violence upon any of these\r\ngarments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St.\r\nClair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no\r\nother exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon\r\nthe sill gave little promise that he could save himself by\r\nswimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of\r\nthe tragedy.\r\n\r\n\"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately\r\nimplicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the\r\nvilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was\r\nknown to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few\r\nseconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could\r\nhardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence\r\nwas one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no\r\nknowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he\r\ncould not account in any way for the presence of the missing\r\ngentleman's clothes.\r\n\r\n\"So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who\r\nlives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was\r\ncertainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.\r\nClair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which\r\nis familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a\r\nprofessional beggar, though in order to avoid the police\r\nregulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some\r\nlittle distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand\r\nside, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the\r\nwall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,\r\ncross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he\r\nis a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the\r\ngreasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I\r\nhave watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of\r\nmaking his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised\r\nat the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His\r\nappearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him\r\nwithout observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face\r\ndisfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has\r\nturned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a\r\npair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular\r\ncontrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid\r\nthe common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he\r\nis ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be\r\nthrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now\r\nlearn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been\r\nthe last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.\"\r\n\r\n\"But a cripple!\" said I. \"What could he have done single-handed\r\nagainst a man in the prime of life?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in\r\nother respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.\r\nSurely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that\r\nweakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional\r\nstrength in the others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray continue your narrative.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the\r\nwindow, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her\r\npresence could be of no help to them in their investigations.\r\nInspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful\r\nexamination of the premises, but without finding anything which\r\nthrew any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not\r\narresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes\r\nduring which he might have communicated with his friend the\r\nLascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and\r\nsearched, without anything being found which could incriminate\r\nhim. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right\r\nshirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been\r\ncut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from\r\nthere, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and\r\nthat the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from\r\nthe same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr.\r\nNeville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in\r\nhis room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to\r\nMrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband\r\nat the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or\r\ndreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the\r\npolice-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in\r\nthe hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\r\n\r\n\"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they\r\nhad feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not\r\nNeville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And\r\nwhat do you think they found in the pockets?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with\r\npennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It\r\nwas no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a\r\nhuman body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between\r\nthe wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the\r\nweighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked\r\naway into the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the\r\nroom. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose\r\nthat this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the\r\nwindow, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed.\r\nWhat would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him\r\nthat he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize\r\nthe coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it\r\nwould occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little\r\ntime, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried\r\nto force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his\r\nLascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.\r\nThere is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret\r\nhoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he\r\nstuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the\r\npockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and\r\nwould have done the same with the other garments had not he heard\r\nthe rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the\r\nwindow when the police appeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly sounds feasible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a\r\nbetter. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the\r\nstation, but it could not be shown that there had ever before\r\nbeen anything against him. He had for years been known as a\r\nprofessional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very\r\nquiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and\r\nthe questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was\r\ndoing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is\r\nhe now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are\r\nall as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot\r\nrecall any case within my experience which looked at the first\r\nglance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of\r\nevents, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great\r\ntown until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and\r\nwe rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us.\r\nJust as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered\r\nvillages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\r\n\r\n\"We are on the outskirts of Lee,\" said my companion. \"We have\r\ntouched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in\r\nMiddlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.\r\nSee that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside\r\nthat lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have\r\nlittle doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?\" I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.\r\nMrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and\r\nyou may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for\r\nmy friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have\r\nno news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!\"\r\n\r\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its\r\nown grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and\r\nspringing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding\r\ngravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door\r\nflew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad\r\nin some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy\r\npink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure\r\noutlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one\r\nhalf-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head\r\nand face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" she cried, \"well?\" And then, seeing that there were two\r\nof us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw\r\nthat my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"No good news?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\n\"No bad?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have\r\nhad a long day.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to\r\nme in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it\r\npossible for me to bring him out and associate him with this\r\ninvestigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to see you,\" said she, pressing my hand warmly.\r\n\"You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our\r\narrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so\r\nsuddenly upon us.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear madam,\" said I, \"I am an old campaigner, and if I were\r\nnot I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of\r\nany assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be\r\nindeed happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said the lady as we entered a\r\nwell-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had\r\nbeen laid out, \"I should very much like to ask you one or two\r\nplain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain\r\nanswer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given\r\nto fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon what point?\"\r\n\r\n\"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question.\r\n\"Frankly, now!\" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking\r\nkeenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\r\n\r\n\"Frankly, then, madam, I do not.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think that he is dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Murdered?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't say that. Perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"And on what day did he meet his death?\"\r\n\r\n\"On Monday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how\r\nit is that I have received a letter from him to-day.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been\r\ngalvanised.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" he roared.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to-day.\" She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of\r\npaper in the air.\r\n\r\n\"May I see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out\r\nupon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I\r\nhad left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The\r\nenvelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend\r\npostmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day\r\nbefore, for it was considerably after midnight.\r\n\r\n\"Coarse writing,\" murmured Holmes. \"Surely this is not your\r\nhusband's writing, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but the enclosure is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go\r\nand inquire as to the address.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you tell that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried\r\nitself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that\r\nblotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight\r\noff, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This\r\nman has written the name, and there has then been a pause before\r\nhe wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not\r\nfamiliar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is\r\nnothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha!\r\nthere has been an enclosure here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of his hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"One?\"\r\n\r\n\"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual\r\nwriting, and yet I know it well.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a\r\nhuge error which it may take some little time to rectify.\r\nWait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf\r\nof a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in\r\nGravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been\r\ngummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been\r\nchewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband's\r\nhand, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"None. Neville wrote those words.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair,\r\nthe clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the\r\ndanger is over.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.\r\nThe ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only\r\nposted to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, much may have happened between.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is\r\nwell with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I\r\nshould know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him\r\nlast he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room\r\nrushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that\r\nsomething had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such\r\na trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman\r\nmay be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical\r\nreasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong\r\npiece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband\r\nis alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away\r\nfrom you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.\"\r\n\r\n\"And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the window open?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he might have called to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He might.\"\r\n\r\n\"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"A call for help, you thought?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He waved his hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the\r\nunexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you thought he was pulled back?\"\r\n\r\n\"He disappeared so suddenly.\"\r\n\r\n\"He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the\r\nroom?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and\r\nthe Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his\r\nordinary clothes on?\"\r\n\r\n\"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare\r\nthroat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about\r\nwhich I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little\r\nsupper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our\r\ndisposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary\r\nafter my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however,\r\nwho, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for\r\ndays, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over,\r\nrearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view\r\nuntil he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his\r\ndata were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now\r\npreparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and\r\nwaistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered\r\nabout the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from\r\nthe sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of\r\nEastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with\r\nan ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front\r\nof him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an\r\nold briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the\r\ncorner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him,\r\nsilent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set\r\naquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he\r\nsat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found\r\nthe summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still\r\nbetween his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was\r\nfull of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of\r\nshag which I had seen upon the previous night.\r\n\r\n\"Awake, Watson?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Game for a morning drive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the\r\nstable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.\" He\r\nchuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed\r\na different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.\r\n\r\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one\r\nwas stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly\r\nfinished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was\r\nputting in the horse.\r\n\r\n\"I want to test a little theory of mine,\" said he, pulling on his\r\nboots. \"I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the\r\npresence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve\r\nto be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the\r\nkey of the affair now.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where is it?\" I asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"In the bathroom,\" he answered. \"Oh, yes, I am not joking,\" he\r\ncontinued, seeing my look of incredulity. \"I have just been\r\nthere, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this\r\nGladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will\r\nnot fit the lock.\"\r\n\r\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into\r\nthe bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and\r\ntrap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both\r\nsprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country\r\ncarts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but\r\nthe lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as\r\nsome city in a dream.\r\n\r\n\"It has been in some points a singular case,\" said Holmes,\r\nflicking the horse on into a gallop. \"I confess that I have been\r\nas blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than\r\nnever to learn it at all.\"\r\n\r\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily\r\nfrom their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey\r\nside. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the\r\nriver, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the\r\nright and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well\r\nknown to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted\r\nhim. One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.\r\n\r\n\"Who is on duty?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Inspector Bradstreet, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?\" A tall, stout official had come\r\ndown the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged\r\njacket. \"I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.\"\r\n\"Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.\" It was a small,\r\noffice-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a\r\ntelephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged\r\nwith being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St.\r\nClair, of Lee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I heard. You have him here?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the cells.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he quiet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dirty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his\r\nface is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been\r\nsettled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you\r\nsaw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to see him very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave\r\nyour bag.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I think that I'll take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good. Come this way, if you please.\" He led us down a\r\npassage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and\r\nbrought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"The third on the right is his,\" said the inspector. \"Here it\r\nis!\" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door\r\nand glanced through.\r\n\r\n\"He is asleep,\" said he. \"You can see him very well.\"\r\n\r\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his\r\nface towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and\r\nheavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his\r\ncalling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his\r\ntattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely\r\ndirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its\r\nrepulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right\r\nacross it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up\r\none side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a\r\nperpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over\r\nhis eyes and forehead.\r\n\r\n\"He's a beauty, isn't he?\" said the inspector.\r\n\r\n\"He certainly needs a wash,\" remarked Holmes. \"I had an idea that\r\nhe might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\"\r\nHe opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my\r\nastonishment, a very large bath-sponge.\r\n\r\n\"He! he! You are a funny one,\" chuckled the inspector.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very\r\nquietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable\r\nfigure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know why not,\" said the inspector. \"He doesn't\r\nlook a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?\" He slipped his\r\nkey into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The\r\nsleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep\r\nslumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge,\r\nand then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the\r\nprisoner's face.\r\n\r\n\"Let me introduce you,\" he shouted, \"to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of\r\nLee, in the county of Kent.\"\r\n\r\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled\r\noff under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the\r\ncoarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had\r\nseamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the\r\nrepulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled\r\nred hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale,\r\nsad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned,\r\nrubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment.\r\nThen suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and\r\nthrew himself down with his face to the pillow.\r\n\r\n\"Great heavens!\" cried the inspector, \"it is, indeed, the missing\r\nman. I know him from the photograph.\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons\r\nhimself to his destiny. \"Be it so,\" said he. \"And pray what am I\r\ncharged with?\"\r\n\r\n\"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be\r\ncharged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of\r\nit,\" said the inspector with a grin. \"Well, I have been\r\ntwenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime\r\nhas been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally\r\ndetained.\"\r\n\r\n\"No crime, but a very great error has been committed,\" said\r\nHolmes. \"You would have done better to have trusted your wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not the wife; it was the children,\" groaned the prisoner.\r\n\"God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My\r\nGod! What an exposure! What can I do?\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him\r\nkindly on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,\" said\r\nhe, \"of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand,\r\nif you convince the police authorities that there is no possible\r\ncase against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the\r\ndetails should find their way into the papers. Inspector\r\nBradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you\r\nmight tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case\r\nwould then never go into court at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless you!\" cried the prisoner passionately. \"I would have\r\nendured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left\r\nmy miserable secret as a family blot to my children.\r\n\r\n\"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a\r\nschoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent\r\neducation. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and\r\nfinally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day\r\nmy editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the\r\nmetropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point\r\nfrom which all my adventures started. It was only by trying\r\nbegging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to\r\nbase my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the\r\nsecrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for\r\nmy skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my\r\nface, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good\r\nscar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a\r\nsmall slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of\r\nhair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business\r\npart of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a\r\nbeggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned\r\nhome in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no\r\nless than 26s. 4d.\r\n\r\n\"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until,\r\nsome time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ\r\nserved upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit's end where to get\r\nthe money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's\r\ngrace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers,\r\nand spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In\r\nten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous\r\nwork at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in\r\na day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on\r\nthe ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my\r\npride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up\r\nreporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first\r\nchosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets\r\nwith coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a\r\nlow den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could\r\nevery morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings\r\ntransform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow,\r\na Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that\r\nmy secret was safe in his possession.\r\n\r\n\"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of\r\nmoney. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London\r\ncould earn 700 pounds a year--which is less than my average\r\ntakings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making\r\nup, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by\r\npractice and made me quite a recognised character in the City.\r\nAll day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me,\r\nand it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.\r\n\r\n\"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the\r\ncountry, and eventually married, without anyone having a\r\nsuspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had\r\nbusiness in the City. She little knew what.\r\n\r\n\"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my\r\nroom above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw,\r\nto my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the\r\nstreet, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of\r\nsurprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my\r\nconfidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from\r\ncoming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that\r\nshe could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on\r\nthose of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's\r\neyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it\r\noccurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that\r\nthe clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening\r\nby my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in\r\nthe bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was\r\nweighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from\r\nthe leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of\r\nthe window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes\r\nwould have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of\r\nconstables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,\r\nI confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr.\r\nNeville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I\r\nwas determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and\r\nhence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would\r\nbe terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the\r\nLascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together\r\nwith a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to\r\nfear.\"\r\n\r\n\"That note only reached her yesterday,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Good God! What a week she must have spent!\"\r\n\r\n\"The police have watched this Lascar,\" said Inspector Bradstreet,\r\n\"and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to\r\npost a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor\r\ncustomer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was it,\" said Holmes, nodding approvingly; \"I have no doubt\r\nof it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?\"\r\n\r\n\"Many times; but what was a fine to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"It must stop here, however,\" said Bradstreet. \"If the police are\r\nto hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps\r\nmay be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out.\r\nI am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for\r\nhaving cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your\r\nresults.\"\r\n\r\n\"I reached this one,\" said my friend, \"by sitting upon five\r\npillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if\r\nwe drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE\r\n\r\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second\r\nmorning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the\r\ncompliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a\r\npurple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the\r\nright, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly\r\nstudied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and\r\non the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable\r\nhard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several\r\nplaces. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair\r\nsuggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the\r\npurpose of examination.\r\n\r\n\"You are engaged,\" said I; \"perhaps I interrupt you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss\r\nmy results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one\"--he jerked his\r\nthumb in the direction of the old hat--\"but there are points in\r\nconnection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and\r\neven of instruction.\"\r\n\r\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his\r\ncrackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows\r\nwere thick with the ice crystals. \"I suppose,\" I remarked, \"that,\r\nhomely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to\r\nit--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of\r\nsome mystery and the punishment of some crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no. No crime,\" said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \"Only one of\r\nthose whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have\r\nfour million human beings all jostling each other within the\r\nspace of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so\r\ndense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events\r\nmay be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be\r\npresented which may be striking and bizarre without being\r\ncriminal. We have already had experience of such.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much so,\" I remarked, \"that of the last six cases which I\r\nhave added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any\r\nlegal crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler\r\npapers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the\r\nadventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt\r\nthat this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.\r\nYou know Peterson, the commissionaire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is to him that this trophy belongs.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is his hat.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will\r\nlook upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual\r\nproblem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon\r\nChristmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I\r\nhave no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's\r\nfire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas\r\nmorning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was\r\nreturning from some small jollification and was making his way\r\nhomeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in\r\nthe gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and\r\ncarrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the\r\ncorner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger\r\nand a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the\r\nman's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and,\r\nswinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.\r\nPeterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his\r\nassailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and\r\nseeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him,\r\ndropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the\r\nlabyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham\r\nCourt Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of\r\nPeterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of\r\nbattle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this\r\nbattered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which surely he restored to their owner?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For\r\nMrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to\r\nthe bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H.\r\nB.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are\r\nsome thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in\r\nthis city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any\r\none of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, did Peterson do?\"\r\n\r\n\"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,\r\nknowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.\r\nThe goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs\r\nthat, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it\r\nshould be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried\r\nit off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose,\r\nwhile I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who\r\nlost his Christmas dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he not advertise?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only as much as we can deduce.\"\r\n\r\n\"From his hat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered\r\nfelt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather\r\nyourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this\r\narticle?\"\r\n\r\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather\r\nruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round\r\nshape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of\r\nred silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's\r\nname; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials \"H. B.\" were\r\nscrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a\r\nhat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was\r\ncracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places,\r\nalthough there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the\r\ndiscoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\r\n\r\n\"I can see nothing,\" said I, handing it back to my friend.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail,\r\nhowever, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in\r\ndrawing your inferences.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\"\r\n\r\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective\r\nfashion which was characteristic of him. \"It is perhaps less\r\nsuggestive than it might have been,\" he remarked, \"and yet there\r\nare a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others\r\nwhich represent at least a strong balance of probability. That\r\nthe man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the\r\nface of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the\r\nlast three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He\r\nhad foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a\r\nmoral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his\r\nfortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,\r\nat work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that\r\nhis wife has ceased to love him.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\r\n\r\n\"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,\" he\r\ncontinued, disregarding my remonstrance. \"He is a man who leads a\r\nsedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is\r\nmiddle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the\r\nlast few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are\r\nthe more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also,\r\nby the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid\r\non in his house.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are certainly joking, Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you\r\nthese results, you are unable to see how they are attained?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I\r\nam unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that\r\nthis man was intellectual?\"\r\n\r\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right\r\nover the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. \"It is\r\na question of cubic capacity,\" said he; \"a man with so large a\r\nbrain must have something in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The decline of his fortunes, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge\r\ncame in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the\r\nband of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could\r\nafford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no\r\nhat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the\r\nforesight and the moral retrogression?\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes laughed. \"Here is the foresight,\" said he putting\r\nhis finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.\r\n\"They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a\r\nsign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his\r\nway to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see\r\nthat he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace\r\nit, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly,\r\nwhich is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other\r\nhand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the\r\nfelt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not\r\nentirely lost his self-respect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your reasoning is certainly plausible.\"\r\n\r\n\"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is\r\ngrizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses\r\nlime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the\r\nlower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of\r\nhair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all\r\nappear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of\r\nlime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey\r\ndust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,\r\nshowing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while\r\nthe marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the\r\nwearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in\r\nthe best of training.\"\r\n\r\n\"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him.\"\r\n\r\n\"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear\r\nWatson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and\r\nwhen your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear\r\nthat you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's\r\naffection.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he might be a bachelor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his\r\nwife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce\r\nthat the gas is not laid on in his house?\"\r\n\r\n\"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I\r\nsee no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt\r\nthat the individual must be brought into frequent contact with\r\nburning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in\r\none hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never\r\ngot tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is very ingenious,\" said I, laughing; \"but since, as\r\nyou said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm\r\ndone save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a\r\nwaste of energy.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew\r\nopen, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment\r\nwith flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!\" he gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off\r\nthrough the kitchen window?\" Holmes twisted himself round upon\r\nthe sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.\r\n\r\n\"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!\" He held out\r\nhis hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly\r\nscintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but\r\nof such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric\r\npoint in the dark hollow of his hand.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. \"By Jove, Peterson!\" said\r\nhe, \"this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you\r\nhave got?\"\r\n\r\n\"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though\r\nit were putty.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!\" I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I\r\nhave read the advertisement about it in The Times every day\r\nlately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be\r\nconjectured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly\r\nnot within a twentieth part of the market price.\"\r\n\r\n\"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!\" The commissionaire\r\nplumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\r\n\r\n\"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are\r\nsentimental considerations in the background which would induce\r\nthe Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but\r\nrecover the gem.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,\" I\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner,\r\na plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's\r\njewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case\r\nhas been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the\r\nmatter here, I believe.\" He rummaged amid his newspapers,\r\nglancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out,\r\ndoubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was\r\nbrought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst.,\r\nabstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the\r\nvaluable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder,\r\nupper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect\r\nthat he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess\r\nof Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might\r\nsolder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had\r\nremained with Horner some little time, but had finally been\r\ncalled away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared,\r\nthat the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco\r\ncasket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was\r\naccustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the\r\ndressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was\r\narrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found\r\neither upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to\r\nthe Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on\r\ndiscovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,\r\nwhere she found matters as described by the last witness.\r\nInspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest\r\nof Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence\r\nin the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for\r\nrobbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate\r\nrefused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to\r\nthe Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion\r\nduring the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was\r\ncarried out of court.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum! So much for the police-court,\" said Holmes thoughtfully,\r\ntossing aside the paper. \"The question for us now to solve is the\r\nsequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to\r\nthe crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You\r\nsee, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much\r\nmore important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the\r\nstone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry\r\nBaker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other\r\ncharacteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set\r\nourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and\r\nascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To\r\ndo this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie\r\nundoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If\r\nthis fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at\r\nthe corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr.\r\nHenry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at\r\n221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very. But will he see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor\r\nman, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his\r\nmischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson\r\nthat he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must\r\nhave bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his\r\nbird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to\r\nsee it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to\r\nit. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency\r\nand have this put in the evening papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"In which, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News,\r\nStandard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir. And this stone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,\r\nPeterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here\r\nwith me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place\r\nof the one which your family is now devouring.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and\r\nheld it against the light. \"It's a bonny thing,\" said he. \"Just\r\nsee how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and\r\nfocus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet\r\nbaits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a\r\nbloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found\r\nin the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable\r\nin having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is\r\nblue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has\r\nalready a sinister history. There have been two murders, a\r\nvitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about\r\nfor the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.\r\nWho would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the\r\ngallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now and\r\ndrop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had\r\nanything to do with the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an\r\nabsolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he\r\nwas carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made\r\nof solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple\r\ntest if we have an answer to our advertisement.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you can do nothing until then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall\r\ncome back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I\r\nshould like to see the solution of so tangled a business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I\r\nbelieve. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I\r\nought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.\"\r\n\r\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past\r\nsix when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I\r\napproached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a\r\ncoat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the\r\nbright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I\r\narrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to\r\nHolmes' room.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,\" said he, rising from his armchair\r\nand greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he\r\ncould so readily assume. \"Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr.\r\nBaker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is\r\nmore adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have\r\njust come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a\r\nbroad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of\r\ngrizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight\r\ntremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his\r\nhabits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in\r\nfront, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded\r\nfrom his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a\r\nslow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the\r\nimpression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had\r\nill-usage at the hands of fortune.\r\n\r\n\"We have retained these things for some days,\" said Holmes,\r\n\"because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your\r\naddress. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.\"\r\n\r\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. \"Shillings have not\r\nbeen so plentiful with me as they once were,\" he remarked. \"I had\r\nno doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off\r\nboth my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a\r\nhopeless attempt at recovering them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to\r\neat it.\"\r\n\r\n\"To eat it!\" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.\r\nBut I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is\r\nabout the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your\r\npurpose equally well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly, certainly,\" answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of\r\nyour own bird, so if you wish--\"\r\n\r\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. \"They might be useful to me as\r\nrelics of my adventure,\" said he, \"but beyond that I can hardly\r\nsee what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are\r\ngoing to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I\r\nwill confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive\r\nupon the sideboard.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug\r\nof his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"There is your hat, then, and there your bird,\" said he. \"By the\r\nway, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one\r\nfrom? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a\r\nbetter grown goose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, sir,\" said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly\r\ngained property under his arm. \"There are a few of us who\r\nfrequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in\r\nthe Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our\r\ngood host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which,\r\non consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to\r\nreceive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the\r\nrest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a\r\nScotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.\" With\r\na comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and\r\nstrode off upon his way.\r\n\r\n\"So much for Mr. Henry Baker,\" said Holmes when he had closed the\r\ndoor behind him. \"It is quite certain that he knows nothing\r\nwhatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not particularly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow\r\nup this clue while it is still hot.\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped\r\ncravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly\r\nin a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out\r\ninto smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out\r\ncrisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter,\r\nWimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into\r\nOxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at\r\nthe Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one\r\nof the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open\r\nthe door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from\r\nthe ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\r\n\r\n\"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,\"\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\n\"My geese!\" The man seemed surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker,\r\nwho was a member of your goose club.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! Whose, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Breckinridge is his name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord,\r\nand prosperity to your house. Good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now for Mr. Breckinridge,\" he continued, buttoning up his coat\r\nas we came out into the frosty air. \"Remember, Watson that though\r\nwe have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we\r\nhave at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal\r\nservitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible\r\nthat our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we\r\nhave a line of investigation which has been missed by the police,\r\nand which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us\r\nfollow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and\r\nquick march!\"\r\n\r\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a\r\nzigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest\r\nstalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor\r\na horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was\r\nhelping a boy to put up the shutters.\r\n\r\n\"Good-evening. It's a cold night,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"Sold out of geese, I see,\" continued Holmes, pointing at the\r\nbare slabs of marble.\r\n\r\n\"Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's no good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but I was recommended to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who by?\"\r\n\r\n\"The landlord of the Alpha.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?\"\r\n\r\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the\r\nsalesman.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, mister,\" said he, with his head cocked and his arms\r\nakimbo, \"what are you driving at? Let's have it straight, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the\r\ngeese which you supplied to the Alpha.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you\r\nshould be so warm over such a trifle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.\r\nWhen I pay good money for a good article there should be an end\r\nof the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you\r\nsell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One\r\nwould think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the\r\nfuss that is made over them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been\r\nmaking inquiries,\" said Holmes carelessly. \"If you won't tell us\r\nthe bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my\r\nopinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the\r\nbird I ate is country bred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred,\" snapped\r\nthe salesman.\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing of the kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled\r\nthem ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that\r\nwent to the Alpha were town bred.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll never persuade me to believe that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you bet, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But\r\nI'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be\r\nobstinate.\"\r\n\r\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. \"Bring me the books, Bill,\" said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great\r\ngreasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging\r\nlamp.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, Mr. Cocksure,\" said the salesman, \"I thought that I\r\nwas out of geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is\r\nstill one left in my shop. You see this little book?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well,\r\nthen, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers\r\nafter their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.\r\nNow, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a\r\nlist of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just\r\nread it out to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249,\" read Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. \"Here you are, 'Mrs.\r\nOakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, what's the last entry?\"\r\n\r\n\"'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. There you are. And underneath?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you to say now?\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from\r\nhis pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the\r\nair of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off\r\nhe stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless\r\nfashion which was peculiar to him.\r\n\r\n\"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un'\r\nprotruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,\"\r\nsaid he. \"I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of\r\nhim, that man would not have given me such complete information\r\nas was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a\r\nwager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our\r\nquest, and the only point which remains to be determined is\r\nwhether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or\r\nwhether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what\r\nthat surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves\r\nwho are anxious about the matter, and I should--\"\r\n\r\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke\r\nout from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a\r\nlittle rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of\r\nyellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while\r\nBreckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was\r\nshaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\r\n\r\n\"I've had enough of you and your geese,\" he shouted. \"I wish you\r\nwere all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more\r\nwith your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs.\r\nOakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with\r\nit? Did I buy the geese off you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but one of them was mine all the same,\" whined the little\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"She told me to ask you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had\r\nenough of it. Get out of this!\" He rushed fiercely forward, and\r\nthe inquirer flitted away into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,\" whispered Holmes.\r\n\"Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this\r\nfellow.\" Striding through the scattered knots of people who\r\nlounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook\r\nthe little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang\r\nround, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of\r\ncolour had been driven from his face.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, then? What do you want?\" he asked in a quavering\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse me,\" said Holmes blandly, \"but I could not help\r\noverhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.\r\nI think that I could be of assistance to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other\r\npeople don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can know nothing of this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to\r\ntrace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton\r\nRoad, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr.\r\nWindigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr.\r\nHenry Baker is a member.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,\" cried\r\nthe little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.\r\n\"I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. \"In that\r\ncase we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this\r\nwind-swept market-place,\" said he. \"But pray tell me, before we\r\ngo farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.\"\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated for an instant. \"My name is John Robinson,\" he\r\nanswered with a sidelong glance.\r\n\r\n\"No, no; the real name,\" said Holmes sweetly. \"It is always\r\nawkward doing business with an alias.\"\r\n\r\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. \"Well then,\"\r\nsaid he, \"my real name is James Ryder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray\r\nstep into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you\r\neverything which you would wish to know.\"\r\n\r\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with\r\nhalf-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure\r\nwhether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.\r\nThen he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in\r\nthe sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during\r\nour drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and\r\nthe claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous\r\ntension within him.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are!\" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.\r\n\"The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold,\r\nMr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my\r\nslippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then!\r\nYou want to know what became of those geese?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in\r\nwhich you were interested--white, with a black bar across the\r\ntail.\"\r\n\r\nRyder quivered with emotion. \"Oh, sir,\" he cried, \"can you tell\r\nme where it went to?\"\r\n\r\n\"It came here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that\r\nyou should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was\r\ndead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.\r\nI have it here in my museum.\"\r\n\r\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece\r\nwith his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up\r\nthe blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold,\r\nbrilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a\r\ndrawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\r\n\r\n\"The game's up, Ryder,\" said Holmes quietly. \"Hold up, man, or\r\nyou'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,\r\nWatson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with\r\nimpunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little\r\nmore human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy\r\nbrought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring\r\nwith frightened eyes at his accuser.\r\n\r\n\"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I\r\ncould possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.\r\nStill, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case\r\ncomplete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the\r\nCountess of Morcar's?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,\" said he in a\r\ncrackling voice.\r\n\r\n\"I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of\r\nsudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has\r\nbeen for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous\r\nin the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the\r\nmaking of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man\r\nHorner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter\r\nbefore, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.\r\nWhat did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's\r\nroom--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he\r\nshould be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled\r\nthe jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man\r\narrested. You then--\"\r\n\r\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my\r\ncompanion's knees. \"For God's sake, have mercy!\" he shrieked.\r\n\"Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I\r\nnever went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll\r\nswear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's\r\nsake, don't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get back into your chair!\" said Holmes sternly. \"It is very well\r\nto cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this\r\npoor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the\r\ncharge against him will break down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account\r\nof the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came\r\nthe goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies\r\nyour only hope of safety.\"\r\n\r\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. \"I will tell you\r\nit just as it happened, sir,\" said he. \"When Horner had been\r\narrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get\r\naway with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment\r\nthe police might not take it into their heads to search me and my\r\nroom. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe.\r\nI went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's\r\nhouse. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton\r\nRoad, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there\r\nevery man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective;\r\nand, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down\r\nmy face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me\r\nwhat was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I\r\nhad been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went\r\ninto the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would\r\nbe best to do.\r\n\r\n\"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and\r\nhas just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met\r\nme, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they\r\ncould get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to\r\nme, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind\r\nto go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my\r\nconfidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money.\r\nBut how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had\r\ngone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be\r\nseized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat\r\npocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at\r\nthe geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly\r\nan idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the\r\nbest detective that ever lived.\r\n\r\n\"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the\r\npick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she\r\nwas always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in\r\nit I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in\r\nthe yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big\r\none, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill\r\nopen, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger\r\ncould reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass\r\nalong its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped\r\nand struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the\r\nmatter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and\r\nfluttered off among the others.\r\n\r\n\"'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I\r\nwas feeling which was the fattest.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we\r\ncall it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six\r\nof them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen\r\nfor the market.'\r\n\r\n\"'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you,\r\nI'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'\r\n\r\n\"'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we\r\nfattened it expressly for you.'\r\n\r\n\"'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it\r\nyou want, then?'\r\n\r\n\"'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the\r\nflock.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird\r\nall the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was\r\na man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed\r\nuntil he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My\r\nheart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I\r\nknew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird,\r\nrushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There\r\nwas not a bird to be seen there.\r\n\r\n\"'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.\r\n\r\n\"'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'\r\n\r\n\"'Which dealer's?'\r\n\r\n\"'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'\r\n\r\n\"'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same\r\nas the one I chose?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never\r\ntell them apart.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my\r\nfeet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the\r\nlot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they\r\nhad gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always\r\nanswered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad.\r\nSometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself\r\na branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which\r\nI sold my character. God help me! God help me!\" He burst into\r\nconvulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and\r\nby the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the\r\nedge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\r\n\r\n\"Get out!\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!\"\r\n\r\n\"No more words. Get out!\"\r\n\r\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon\r\nthe stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running\r\nfootfalls from the street.\r\n\r\n\"After all, Watson,\" said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his\r\nclay pipe, \"I am not retained by the police to supply their\r\ndeficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing;\r\nbut this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must\r\ncollapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just\r\npossible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong\r\nagain; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and\r\nyou make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of\r\nforgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and\r\nwhimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you\r\nwill have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin\r\nanother investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief\r\nfeature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND\r\n\r\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I\r\nhave during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend\r\nSherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number\r\nmerely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did\r\nrather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of\r\nwealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation\r\nwhich did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.\r\nOf all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which\r\npresented more singular features than that which was associated\r\nwith the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.\r\nThe events in question occurred in the early days of my\r\nassociation with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors\r\nin Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them\r\nupon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the\r\ntime, from which I have only been freed during the last month by\r\nthe untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It\r\nis perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I\r\nhave reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the\r\ndeath of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even\r\nmore terrible than the truth.\r\n\r\nIt was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to\r\nfind Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my\r\nbed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the\r\nmantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I\r\nblinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little\r\nresentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\r\n\r\n\"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,\" said he, \"but it's the\r\ncommon lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she\r\nretorted upon me, and I on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, then--a fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a\r\nconsiderable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She\r\nis waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander\r\nabout the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock\r\nsleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is\r\nsomething very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it\r\nprove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to\r\nfollow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should\r\ncall you and give you the chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\"\r\n\r\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his\r\nprofessional investigations, and in admiring the rapid\r\ndeductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a\r\nlogical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were\r\nsubmitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in\r\na few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A\r\nlady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in\r\nthe window, rose as we entered.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning, madam,\" said Holmes cheerily. \"My name is Sherlock\r\nHolmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson,\r\nbefore whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am\r\nglad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the\r\nfire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot\r\ncoffee, for I observe that you are shivering.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not cold which makes me shiver,\" said the woman in a low\r\nvoice, changing her seat as requested.\r\n\r\n\"What, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.\" She raised her veil as\r\nshe spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable\r\nstate of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless\r\nfrightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features\r\nand figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot\r\nwith premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.\r\nSherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick,\r\nall-comprehensive glances.\r\n\r\n\"You must not fear,\" said he soothingly, bending forward and\r\npatting her forearm. \"We shall soon set matters right, I have no\r\ndoubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know me, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm\r\nof your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had\r\na good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached\r\nthe station.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"There is no mystery, my dear madam,\" said he, smiling. \"The left\r\narm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven\r\nplaces. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a\r\ndog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you\r\nsit on the left-hand side of the driver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,\" said\r\nshe. \"I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at\r\ntwenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I\r\ncan stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.\r\nI have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me,\r\nand he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you,\r\nMr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you\r\nhelped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had\r\nyour address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me,\r\ntoo, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness\r\nwhich surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward\r\nyou for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be\r\nmarried, with the control of my own income, and then at least you\r\nshall not find me ungrateful.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small\r\ncase-book, which he consulted.\r\n\r\n\"Farintosh,\" said he. \"Ah yes, I recall the case; it was\r\nconcerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time,\r\nWatson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote\r\nthe same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to\r\nreward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty\r\nto defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which\r\nsuits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us\r\neverything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" replied our visitor, \"the very horror of my situation\r\nlies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions\r\ndepend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to\r\nanother, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to\r\nlook for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it\r\nas the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can\r\nread it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have\r\nheard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold\r\nwickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid\r\nthe dangers which encompass me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am all attention, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who\r\nis the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in\r\nEngland, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of\r\nSurrey.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes nodded his head. \"The name is familiar to me,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the\r\nestates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north,\r\nand Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four\r\nsuccessive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition,\r\nand the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the\r\ndays of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground,\r\nand the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under\r\na heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence\r\nthere, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but\r\nhis only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to\r\nthe new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which\r\nenabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta,\r\nwhere, by his professional skill and his force of character, he\r\nestablished a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused\r\nby some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he\r\nbeat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital\r\nsentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and\r\nafterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\r\n\r\n\"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner,\r\nthe young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery.\r\nMy sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old\r\nat the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable\r\nsum of money--not less than 1000 pounds a year--and this she\r\nbequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him,\r\nwith a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to\r\neach of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return\r\nto England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a\r\nrailway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his\r\nattempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us\r\nto live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The\r\nmoney which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and\r\nthere seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\r\n\r\n\"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.\r\nInstead of making friends and exchanging visits with our\r\nneighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of\r\nStoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in\r\nhis house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious\r\nquarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper\r\napproaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the\r\nfamily, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been\r\nintensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of\r\ndisgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the\r\npolice-court, until at last he became the terror of the village,\r\nand the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of\r\nimmense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\r\n\r\n\"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a\r\nstream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I\r\ncould gather together that I was able to avert another public\r\nexposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies,\r\nand he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few\r\nacres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate,\r\nand would accept in return the hospitality of their tents,\r\nwandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a\r\npassion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a\r\ncorrespondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon,\r\nwhich wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the\r\nvillagers almost as much as their master.\r\n\r\n\"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I\r\nhad no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with\r\nus, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was\r\nbut thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already\r\nbegun to whiten, even as mine has.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your sister is dead, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish\r\nto speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I\r\nhave described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own\r\nage and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden\r\nsister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we\r\nwere occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's\r\nhouse. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there\r\na half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My\r\nstepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and\r\noffered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of\r\nthe day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event\r\noccurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes\r\nclosed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his\r\nlids now and glanced across at his visitor.\r\n\r\n\"Pray be precise as to details,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful\r\ntime is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have\r\nalready said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The\r\nbedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms\r\nbeing in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms\r\nthe first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third\r\nmy own. There is no communication between them, but they all open\r\nout into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly so.\"\r\n\r\n\"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That\r\nfatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we\r\nknew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled\r\nby the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom\r\nto smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where\r\nshe sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At\r\neleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door\r\nand looked back.\r\n\r\n\"'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle\r\nin the dead of the night?'\r\n\r\n\"'Never,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in\r\nyour sleep?'\r\n\r\n\"'Certainly not. But why?'\r\n\r\n\"'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three\r\nin the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper,\r\nand it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps\r\nfrom the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would\r\njust ask you whether you had heard it.'\r\n\r\n\"'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the\r\nplantation.'\r\n\r\n\"'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you\r\ndid not hear it also.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled\r\nback at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her\r\nkey turn in the lock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said Holmes. \"Was it your custom always to lock\r\nyourselves in at night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Always.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah\r\nand a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were\r\nlocked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending\r\nmisfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect,\r\nwere twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two\r\nsouls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind\r\nwas howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing\r\nagainst the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale,\r\nthere burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew\r\nthat it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a\r\nshawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door\r\nI seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and\r\na few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had\r\nfallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked,\r\nand revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it\r\nhorror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By\r\nthe light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the\r\nopening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for\r\nhelp, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a\r\ndrunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that\r\nmoment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.\r\nShe writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were\r\ndreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not\r\nrecognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out\r\nin a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was\r\nthe band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she\r\nwould fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the\r\nair in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion\r\nseized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for\r\nmy stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his\r\ndressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was\r\nunconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent\r\nfor medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for\r\nshe slowly sank and died without having recovered her\r\nconsciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment,\" said Holmes, \"are you sure about this whistle and\r\nmetallic sound? Could you swear to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is\r\nmy strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of\r\nthe gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have\r\nbeen deceived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was your sister dressed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the\r\ncharred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.\"\r\n\r\n\"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when\r\nthe alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did\r\nthe coroner come to?\"\r\n\r\n\"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's\r\nconduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable\r\nto find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that\r\nthe door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows\r\nwere blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars,\r\nwhich were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded,\r\nand were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was\r\nalso thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is\r\nwide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain,\r\ntherefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.\r\nBesides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about poison?\"\r\n\r\n\"The doctors examined her for it, but without success.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock,\r\nthough what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there are nearly always some there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a\r\nspeckled band?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of\r\ndelirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of\r\npeople, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not\r\nknow whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear\r\nover their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which\r\nshe used.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"These are very deep waters,\" said he; \"pray go on with your\r\nnarrative.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until\r\nlately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend,\r\nwhom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask\r\nmy hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the\r\nsecond son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My\r\nstepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to\r\nbe married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs\r\nwere started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom\r\nwall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the\r\nchamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in\r\nwhich she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last\r\nnight, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I\r\nsuddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which\r\nhad been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the\r\nlamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to\r\ngo to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was\r\ndaylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which\r\nis opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on\r\nthis morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your\r\nadvice.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have done wisely,\" said my friend. \"But have you told me\r\nall?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which\r\nfringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little\r\nlivid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed\r\nupon the white wrist.\r\n\r\n\"You have been cruelly used,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. \"He\r\nis a hard man,\" she said, \"and perhaps he hardly knows his own\r\nstrength.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin\r\nupon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.\r\n\r\n\"This is a very deep business,\" he said at last. \"There are a\r\nthousand details which I should desire to know before I decide\r\nupon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If\r\nwe were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for\r\nus to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your\r\nstepfather?\"\r\n\r\n\"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some\r\nmost important business. It is probable that he will be away all\r\nday, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a\r\nhousekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily\r\nget her out of the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am\r\nin town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to\r\nbe there in time for your coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some\r\nsmall business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and\r\nbreakfast?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have\r\nconfided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you\r\nagain this afternoon.\" She dropped her thick black veil over her\r\nface and glided from the room.\r\n\r\n\"And what do you think of it all, Watson?\" asked Sherlock Holmes,\r\nleaning back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dark enough and sinister enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls\r\nare sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable,\r\nthen her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her\r\nmysterious end.\"\r\n\r\n\"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the\r\nvery peculiar words of the dying woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot think.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of\r\na band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor,\r\nthe fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has\r\nan interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying\r\nallusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner\r\nheard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of\r\nthose metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its\r\nplace, I think that there is good ground to think that the\r\nmystery may be cleared along those lines.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what, then, did the gipsies do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see many objections to any such theory.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going\r\nto Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are\r\nfatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of\r\nthe devil!\"\r\n\r\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that\r\nour door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had\r\nframed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar\r\nmixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a\r\nblack top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters,\r\nwith a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his\r\nhat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his\r\nbreadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face,\r\nseared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and\r\nmarked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other\r\nof us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\r\nfleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old\r\nbird of prey.\r\n\r\n\"Which of you is Holmes?\" asked this apparition.\r\n\r\n\"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\" said my\r\ncompanion quietly.\r\n\r\n\"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Doctor,\" said Holmes blandly. \"Pray take a seat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I\r\nhave traced her. What has she been saying to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a little cold for the time of the year,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"What has she been saying to you?\" screamed the old man\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\n\"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,\" continued my\r\ncompanion imperturbably.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! You put me off, do you?\" said our new visitor, taking a step\r\nforward and shaking his hunting-crop. \"I know you, you scoundrel!\r\nI have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Holmes, the busybody!\"\r\n\r\nHis smile broadened.\r\n\r\n\"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!\"\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled heartily. \"Your conversation is most\r\nentertaining,\" said he. \"When you go out close the door, for\r\nthere is a decided draught.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with\r\nmy affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her!\r\nI am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.\" He stepped\r\nswiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with\r\nhis huge brown hands.\r\n\r\n\"See that you keep yourself out of my grip,\" he snarled, and\r\nhurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"He seems a very amiable person,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"I am\r\nnot quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him\r\nthat my grip was not much more feeble than his own.\" As he spoke\r\nhe picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort,\r\nstraightened it out again.\r\n\r\n\"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\r\ndetective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,\r\nhowever, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer\r\nfrom her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now,\r\nWatson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk\r\ndown to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may\r\nhelp us in this matter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\r\nexcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled\r\nover with notes and figures.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen the will of the deceased wife,\" said he. \"To\r\ndetermine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the\r\npresent prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The\r\ntotal income, which at the time of the wife's death was little\r\nshort of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural\r\nprices, not more than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an\r\nincome of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have\r\nhad a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to\r\na very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted,\r\nsince it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for\r\nstanding in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson,\r\nthis is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is\r\naware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you\r\nare ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be\r\nvery much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your\r\npocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen\r\nwho can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush\r\nare, I think, all that we need.\"\r\n\r\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for\r\nLeatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove\r\nfor four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a\r\nperfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the\r\nheavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out\r\ntheir first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant\r\nsmell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange\r\ncontrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this\r\nsinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in\r\nthe front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over\r\nhis eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the\r\ndeepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the\r\nshoulder, and pointed over the meadows.\r\n\r\n\"Look there!\" said he.\r\n\r\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope,\r\nthickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the\r\nbranches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a\r\nvery old mansion.\r\n\r\n\"Stoke Moran?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,\" remarked\r\nthe driver.\r\n\r\n\"There is some building going on there,\" said Holmes; \"that is\r\nwhere we are going.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's the village,\" said the driver, pointing to a cluster of\r\nroofs some distance to the left; \"but if you want to get to the\r\nhouse, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by\r\nthe foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is\r\nwalking.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,\" observed Holmes, shading\r\nhis eyes. \"Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.\"\r\n\r\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way\r\nto Leatherhead.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it as well,\" said Holmes as we climbed the stile,\r\n\"that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or\r\non some definite business. It may stop his gossip.\r\nGood-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as\r\nour word.\"\r\n\r\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a\r\nface which spoke her joy. \"I have been waiting so eagerly for\r\nyou,\" she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. \"All has turned\r\nout splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely\r\nthat he will be back before evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance,\"\r\nsaid Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had\r\noccurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" she cried, \"he has followed me, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it appears.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What\r\nwill he say when he returns?\"\r\n\r\n\"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone\r\nmore cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself\r\nup from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to\r\nyour aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our\r\ntime, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to\r\nexamine.\"\r\n\r\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high\r\ncentral portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab,\r\nthrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were\r\nbroken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly\r\ncaved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little\r\nbetter repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern,\r\nand the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up\r\nfrom the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.\r\nSome scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the\r\nstone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any\r\nworkmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and\r\ndown the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the\r\noutsides of the windows.\r\n\r\n\"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep,\r\nthe centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main\r\nbuilding to Dr. Roylott's chamber?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does\r\nnot seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end\r\nwall.\"\r\n\r\n\"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from\r\nmy room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow\r\nwing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There\r\nare windows in it, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass\r\nthrough.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were\r\nunapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness\r\nto go into your room and bar your shutters?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination\r\nthrough the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the\r\nshutter open, but without success. There was no slit through\r\nwhich a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his\r\nlens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built\r\nfirmly into the massive masonry. \"Hum!\" said he, scratching his\r\nchin in some perplexity, \"my theory certainly presents some\r\ndifficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were\r\nbolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon\r\nthe matter.\"\r\n\r\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which\r\nthe three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third\r\nchamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss\r\nStoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her\r\nfate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a\r\ngaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A\r\nbrown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow\r\nwhite-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the\r\nleft-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small\r\nwicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save\r\nfor a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and\r\nthe panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old\r\nand discoloured that it may have dated from the original building\r\nof the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat\r\nsilent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down,\r\ntaking in every detail of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\"Where does that bell communicate with?\" he asked at last\r\npointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the\r\ntassel actually lying upon the pillow.\r\n\r\n\"It goes to the housekeeper's room.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks newer than the other things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we\r\nwanted for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.\r\nYou will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to\r\nthis floor.\" He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in\r\nhis hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining\r\nminutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with\r\nthe wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he\r\nwalked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and\r\nin running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the\r\nbell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's a dummy,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Won't it ring?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting.\r\nYou can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where\r\nthe little opening for the ventilator is.\"\r\n\r\n\"How very absurd! I never noticed that before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very strange!\" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. \"There are\r\none or two very singular points about this room. For example,\r\nwhat a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another\r\nroom, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated\r\nwith the outside air!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is also quite modern,\" said the lady.\r\n\r\n\"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?\" remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy\r\nbell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your\r\npermission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into\r\nthe inner apartment.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his\r\nstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small\r\nwooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an\r\narmchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a\r\nround table, and a large iron safe were the principal things\r\nwhich met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each\r\nand all of them with the keenest interest.\r\n\r\n\"What's in here?\" he asked, tapping the safe.\r\n\r\n\"My stepfather's business papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you have seen inside, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of\r\npapers.\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn't a cat in it, for example?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. What a strange idea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, look at this!\" He took up a small saucer of milk which\r\nstood on the top of it.\r\n\r\n\"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a\r\nsaucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I\r\ndaresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.\" He\r\nsquatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat\r\nof it with the greatest attention.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. That is quite settled,\" said he, rising and putting\r\nhis lens in his pocket. \"Hullo! Here is something interesting!\"\r\n\r\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on\r\none corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself\r\nand tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of that, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be\r\ntied.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world,\r\nand when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst\r\nof all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and\r\nwith your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.\"\r\n\r\nI had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as\r\nit was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We\r\nhad walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss\r\nStoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he\r\nroused himself from his reverie.\r\n\r\n\"It is very essential, Miss Stoner,\" said he, \"that you should\r\nabsolutely follow my advice in every respect.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall most certainly do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may\r\ndepend upon your compliance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you that I am in your hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in\r\nyour room.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the\r\nvillage inn over there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is the Crown.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a\r\nheadache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him\r\nretire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window,\r\nundo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then\r\nwithdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want\r\ninto the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in\r\nspite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rest you will leave in our hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what will you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate\r\nthe cause of this noise which has disturbed you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,\"\r\nsaid Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and\r\nif she died from some sudden fright.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more\r\ntangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if\r\nDr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.\r\nGood-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you,\r\nyou may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers\r\nthat threaten you.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and\r\nsitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and\r\nfrom our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and\r\nof the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw\r\nDr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside\r\nthe little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some\r\nslight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard\r\nthe hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which\r\nhe shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few\r\nminutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as\r\nthe lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Watson,\" said Holmes as we sat together in the\r\ngathering darkness, \"I have really some scruples as to taking you\r\nto-night. There is a distinct element of danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I be of assistance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your presence might be invaluable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall certainly come.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very kind of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms\r\nthan was visible to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine\r\nthat you saw all that I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose\r\nthat could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"You saw the ventilator, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to\r\nhave a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a\r\nrat could hardly pass through.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to\r\nStoke Moran.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her\r\nsister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that\r\nsuggested at once that there must be a communication between the\r\ntwo rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been\r\nremarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what harm can there be in that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A\r\nventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the\r\nbed dies. Does not that strike you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot as yet see any connection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened\r\nlike that before?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say that I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same\r\nrelative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may\r\ncall it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holmes,\" I cried, \"I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.\r\nWe are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible\r\ncrime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong\r\nhe is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge.\r\nPalmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.\r\nThis man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall\r\nbe able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough\r\nbefore the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet\r\npipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more\r\ncheerful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished,\r\nand all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours\r\npassed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of\r\neleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\r\n\r\n\"That is our signal,\" said Holmes, springing to his feet; \"it\r\ncomes from the middle window.\"\r\n\r\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord,\r\nexplaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance,\r\nand that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A\r\nmoment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing\r\nin our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us\r\nthrough the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\r\n\r\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for\r\nunrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way\r\namong the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about\r\nto enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel\r\nbushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted\r\nchild, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and\r\nthen ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" I whispered; \"did you see it?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like\r\na vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low\r\nlaugh and put his lips to my ear.\r\n\r\n\"It is a nice household,\" he murmured. \"That is the baboon.\"\r\n\r\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There\r\nwas a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders\r\nat any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when,\r\nafter following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I\r\nfound myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed\r\nthe shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes\r\nround the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then\r\ncreeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered\r\ninto my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to\r\ndistinguish the words:\r\n\r\n\"The least sound would be fatal to our plans.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\r\n\r\n\"We must sit without light. He would see it through the\r\nventilator.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded again.\r\n\r\n\"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your\r\npistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of\r\nthe bed, and you in that chair.\"\r\n\r\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\r\n\r\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon\r\nthe bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the\r\nstump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left\r\nin darkness.\r\n\r\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a\r\nsound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my\r\ncompanion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same\r\nstate of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut\r\noff the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\r\n\r\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at\r\nour very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that\r\nthe cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the\r\ndeep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of\r\nan hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and\r\none and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for\r\nwhatever might befall.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the\r\ndirection of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was\r\nsucceeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.\r\nSomeone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle\r\nsound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the\r\nsmell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears.\r\nThen suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle,\r\nsoothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping\r\ncontinually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes\r\nsprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\r\nhis cane at the bell-pull.\r\n\r\n\"You see it, Watson?\" he yelled. \"You see it?\"\r\n\r\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I\r\nheard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my\r\nweary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which\r\nmy friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face\r\nwas deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had\r\nceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when\r\nsuddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most\r\nhorrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder\r\nand louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled\r\nin the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the\r\nvillage, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the\r\nsleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I\r\nstood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it\r\nhad died away into the silence from which it rose.\r\n\r\n\"What can it mean?\" I gasped.\r\n\r\n\"It means that it is all over,\" Holmes answered. \"And perhaps,\r\nafter all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will\r\nenter Dr. Roylott's room.\"\r\n\r\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the\r\ncorridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply\r\nfrom within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his\r\nheels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a\r\ndark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant\r\nbeam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.\r\nBeside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott\r\nclad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding\r\nbeneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.\r\nAcross his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we\r\nhad noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his\r\neyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the\r\nceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with\r\nbrownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his\r\nhead. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\r\n\r\n\"The band! the speckled band!\" whispered Holmes.\r\n\r\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began\r\nto move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat\r\ndiamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\r\n\r\n\"It is a swamp adder!\" cried Holmes; \"the deadliest snake in\r\nIndia. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence\r\ndoes, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls\r\ninto the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this\r\ncreature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to\r\nsome place of shelter and let the county police know what has\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap,\r\nand throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from\r\nits horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into\r\nthe iron safe, which he closed upon it.\r\n\r\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of\r\nStoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a\r\nnarrative which has already run to too great a length by telling\r\nhow we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed\r\nher by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow,\r\nof how the slow process of official inquiry came to the\r\nconclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly\r\nplaying with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn\r\nof the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\n\"I had,\" said he, \"come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which\r\nshows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\r\ninsufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of\r\nthe word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to\r\nexplain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of\r\nby the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an\r\nentirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly\r\nreconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me\r\nthat whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not\r\ncome either from the window or the door. My attention was\r\nspeedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this\r\nventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The\r\ndiscovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to\r\nthe floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was\r\nthere as a bridge for something passing through the hole and\r\ncoming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me,\r\nand when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was\r\nfurnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I\r\nwas probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of\r\npoison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical\r\ntest was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless\r\nman who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such\r\na poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be\r\nan advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could\r\ndistinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where\r\nthe poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the\r\nwhistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning\r\nlight revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by\r\nthe use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.\r\nHe would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he\r\nthought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the\r\nrope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the\r\noccupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but\r\nsooner or later she must fall a victim.\r\n\r\n\"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his\r\nroom. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in\r\nthe habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary\r\nin order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the\r\nsafe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to\r\nfinally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic\r\nclang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather\r\nhastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.\r\nHaving once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in\r\norder to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss\r\nas I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the\r\nlight and attacked it.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the result of driving it through the ventilator.\"\r\n\r\n\"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master\r\nat the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and\r\nroused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person\r\nit saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.\r\nGrimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to\r\nweigh very heavily upon my conscience.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB\r\n\r\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.\r\nSherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy,\r\nthere were only two which I was the means of introducing to his\r\nnotice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel\r\nWarburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a\r\nfiner field for an acute and original observer, but the other was\r\nso strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that\r\nit may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it\r\ngave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of\r\nreasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story\r\nhas, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but,\r\nlike all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when\r\nset forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the\r\nfacts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears\r\ngradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads\r\non to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a\r\ndeep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly\r\nserved to weaken the effect.\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the\r\nevents occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned\r\nto civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker\r\nStreet rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally\r\neven persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come\r\nand visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I\r\nhappened to live at no very great distance from Paddington\r\nStation, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of\r\nthese, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was\r\nnever weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send\r\nme on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.\r\n\r\nOne morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by\r\nthe maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come\r\nfrom Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I\r\ndressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases\r\nwere seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my\r\nold ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door\r\ntightly behind him.\r\n\r\n\"I've got him here,\" he whispered, jerking his thumb over his\r\nshoulder; \"he's all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, then?\" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was\r\nsome strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\r\n\r\n\"It's a new patient,\" he whispered. \"I thought I'd bring him\r\nround myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe\r\nand sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the\r\nsame as you.\" And off he went, this trusty tout, without even\r\ngiving me time to thank him.\r\n\r\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the\r\ntable. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a\r\nsoft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of\r\nhis hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all\r\nover with bloodstains. He was young, not more than\r\nfive-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but\r\nhe was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who\r\nwas suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his\r\nstrength of mind to control.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,\" said he, \"but I\r\nhave had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by\r\ntrain this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I\r\nmight find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me\r\nhere. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon\r\nthe side-table.\"\r\n\r\nI took it up and glanced at it. \"Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic\r\nengineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).\" That was the name,\r\nstyle, and abode of my morning visitor. \"I regret that I have\r\nkept you waiting,\" said I, sitting down in my library-chair. \"You\r\nare fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself\r\na monotonous occupation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,\" said he, and\r\nlaughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note,\r\nleaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical\r\ninstincts rose up against that laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Stop it!\" I cried; \"pull yourself together!\" and I poured out\r\nsome water from a caraffe.\r\n\r\nIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical\r\noutbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis\r\nis over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very\r\nweary and pale-looking.\r\n\r\n\"I have been making a fool of myself,\" he gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. Drink this.\" I dashed some brandy into the water,\r\nand the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"That's better!\" said he. \"And now, Doctor, perhaps you would\r\nkindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb\r\nused to be.\"\r\n\r\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even\r\nmy hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four\r\nprotruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the\r\nthumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from\r\nthe roots.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" I cried, \"this is a terrible injury. It must have\r\nbled considerably.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must\r\nhave been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that\r\nit was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very\r\ntightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own\r\nprovince.\"\r\n\r\n\"This has been done,\" said I, examining the wound, \"by a very\r\nheavy and sharp instrument.\"\r\n\r\n\"A thing like a cleaver,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"An accident, I presume?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! a murderous attack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very murderous indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You horrify me.\"\r\n\r\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered\r\nit over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back\r\nwithout wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\" I asked when I had finished.\r\n\r\n\"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.\r\nI was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently\r\ntrying to your nerves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police;\r\nbut, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing\r\nevidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they\r\nbelieved my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I\r\nhave not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and,\r\neven if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so\r\nvague that it is a question whether justice will be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" cried I, \"if it is anything in the nature of a problem\r\nwhich you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you\r\nto come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the\r\nofficial police.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have heard of that fellow,\" answered my visitor, \"and I\r\nshould be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of\r\ncourse I must use the official police as well. Would you give me\r\nan introduction to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be immensely obliged to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to\r\nhave a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an\r\ninstant.\" I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my\r\nwife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my\r\nnew acquaintance to Baker Street.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his\r\nsitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The\r\nTimes and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed\r\nof all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day\r\nbefore, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the\r\nmantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion,\r\nordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal.\r\nWhen it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the\r\nsofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of\r\nbrandy and water within his reach.\r\n\r\n\"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one,\r\nMr. Hatherley,\" said he. \"Pray, lie down there and make yourself\r\nabsolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are\r\ntired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said my patient, \"but I have felt another man since\r\nthe doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has\r\ncompleted the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable\r\ntime as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar\r\nexperiences.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded\r\nexpression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat\r\nopposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story\r\nwhich our visitor detailed to us.\r\n\r\n\"You must know,\" said he, \"that I am an orphan and a bachelor,\r\nresiding alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a\r\nhydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my\r\nwork during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner &\r\nMatheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago,\r\nhaving served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of\r\nmoney through my poor father's death, I determined to start in\r\nbusiness for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in\r\nbusiness a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so.\r\nDuring two years I have had three consultations and one small\r\njob, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought\r\nme. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds 10s. Every day, from\r\nnine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my\r\nlittle den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to\r\nbelieve that I should never have any practice at all.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the\r\noffice, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who\r\nwished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with\r\nthe name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at\r\nhis heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle\r\nsize, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have\r\never seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose\r\nand chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over\r\nhis outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his\r\nnatural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his\r\nstep brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly\r\ndressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than\r\nthirty.\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent.\r\n'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man\r\nwho is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet\r\nand capable of preserving a secret.'\r\n\r\n\"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an\r\naddress. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just\r\nat this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both\r\nan orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.'\r\n\r\n\"'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if\r\nI say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional\r\nqualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter\r\nthat you wished to speak to me?'\r\n\r\n\"'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to\r\nthe point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute\r\nsecrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and\r\nof course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than\r\nfrom one who lives in the bosom of his family.'\r\n\r\n\"'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely\r\ndepend upon my doing so.'\r\n\r\n\"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I\r\nhad never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, I promise.'\r\n\r\n\"'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No\r\nreference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?'\r\n\r\n\"'I have already given you my word.'\r\n\r\n\"'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning\r\nacross the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was\r\nempty.\r\n\r\n\"'That's all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know that clerks are\r\nsometimes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we can talk\r\nin safety.' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to\r\nstare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\r\n\r\n\"A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun\r\nto rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man.\r\nEven my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from\r\nshowing my impatience.\r\n\r\n\"'I beg that you will state your business, sir,' said I; 'my time\r\nis of value.' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the\r\nwords came to my lips.\r\n\r\n\"'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Most admirably.'\r\n\r\n\"'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. I\r\nsimply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which\r\nhas got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon\r\nset it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as\r\nthat?'\r\n\r\n\"'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'\r\n\r\n\"'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last\r\ntrain.'\r\n\r\n\"'Where to?'\r\n\r\n\"'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders\r\nof Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a\r\ntrain from Paddington which would bring you there at about\r\n11:15.'\r\n\r\n\"'Very good.'\r\n\r\n\"'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'\r\n\r\n\"'There is a drive, then?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good\r\nseven miles from Eyford Station.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there\r\nwould be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop\r\nthe night.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'\r\n\r\n\"'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient\r\nhour?'\r\n\r\n\"'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to\r\nrecompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a\r\nyoung and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the\r\nvery heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would\r\nlike to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do\r\nso.'\r\n\r\n\"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they\r\nwould be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be very happy to\r\naccommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to\r\nunderstand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to\r\ndo.'\r\n\r\n\"'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which\r\nwe have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I\r\nhave no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all\r\nlaid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from\r\neavesdroppers?'\r\n\r\n\"'Entirely.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that\r\nfuller's-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found\r\nin one or two places in England?'\r\n\r\n\"'I have heard so.'\r\n\r\n\"'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small\r\nplace--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to\r\ndiscover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my\r\nfields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a\r\ncomparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two\r\nvery much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them,\r\nhowever, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were\r\nabsolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was\r\nquite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my\r\ninterest to buy their land before they discovered its true value,\r\nbut unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I\r\ntook a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they\r\nsuggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little\r\ndeposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would\r\nenable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been\r\ndoing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we\r\nerected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already\r\nexplained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the\r\nsubject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it\r\nonce became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our\r\nlittle house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts\r\ncame out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these\r\nfields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you\r\npromise me that you will not tell a human being that you are\r\ngoing to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'\r\n\r\n\"'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not\r\nquite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press\r\nin excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out\r\nlike gravel from a pit.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress\r\nthe earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing\r\nwhat they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully\r\ninto my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I\r\ntrust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at\r\nEyford at 11:15.'\r\n\r\n\"'I shall certainly be there.'\r\n\r\n\"'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long,\r\nquestioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank\r\ngrasp, he hurried from the room.\r\n\r\n\"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very\r\nmuch astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission\r\nwhich had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was\r\nglad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked\r\nhad I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that\r\nthis order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face\r\nand manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon\r\nme, and I could not think that his explanation of the\r\nfuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my\r\ncoming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell\r\nanyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate\r\na hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having\r\nobeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\r\n\r\n\"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.\r\nHowever, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I\r\nreached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the\r\nonly passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the\r\nplatform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed\r\nout through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of\r\nthe morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a\r\nword he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door\r\nof which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either\r\nside, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the\r\nhorse could go.\"\r\n\r\n\"One horse?\" interjected Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, only one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you observe the colour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the\r\ncarriage. It was a chestnut.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tired-looking or fresh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, fresh and glossy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue\r\nyour most interesting statement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel\r\nLysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I\r\nshould think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the\r\ntime that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat\r\nat my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than\r\nonce when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me\r\nwith great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good\r\nin that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I\r\ntried to look out of the windows to see something of where we\r\nwere, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out\r\nnothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now\r\nand then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the\r\njourney, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the\r\nconversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the\r\nroad was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive,\r\nand the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang\r\nout, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch\r\nwhich gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of\r\nthe carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the\r\nmost fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that\r\nI had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,\r\nand I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage\r\ndrove away.\r\n\r\n\"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled\r\nabout looking for matches and muttering under his breath.\r\nSuddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a\r\nlong, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew\r\nbroader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she\r\nheld above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.\r\nI could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which\r\nthe light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich\r\nmaterial. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as\r\nthough asking a question, and when my companion answered in a\r\ngruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly\r\nfell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered\r\nsomething in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room\r\nfrom whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the\r\nlamp in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a\r\nfew minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a\r\nquiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the\r\ncentre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel\r\nStark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the\r\ndoor. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and\r\nvanished into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my\r\nignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises\r\non science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked\r\nacross to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of\r\nthe country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded\r\nacross it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old\r\nclock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise\r\neverything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began\r\nto steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were\r\nthey doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And\r\nwhere was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was\r\nall I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no\r\nidea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns,\r\nwere within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded,\r\nafter all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness,\r\nthat we were in the country. I paced up and down the room,\r\nhumming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling\r\nthat I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the\r\nutter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman\r\nwas standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind\r\nher, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and\r\nbeautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with\r\nfear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one\r\nshaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few\r\nwhispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back,\r\nlike those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\r\n\r\n\"'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to\r\nspeak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no\r\ngood for you to do.'\r\n\r\n\"'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I\r\ncannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'\r\n\r\n\"'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass\r\nthrough the door; no one hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled\r\nand shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and\r\nmade a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love\r\nof Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too\r\nlate!'\r\n\r\n\"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to\r\nengage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I\r\nthought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of\r\nthe unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to\r\ngo for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried\r\nout my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This\r\nwoman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout\r\nbearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I\r\ncared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention\r\nof remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties\r\nwhen a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps\r\nwas heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up\r\nher hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and\r\nas noiselessly as she had come.\r\n\r\n\"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man\r\nwith a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double\r\nchin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\r\n\r\n\"'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the\r\nway, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just\r\nnow. I fear that you have felt the draught.'\r\n\r\n\"'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I\r\nfelt the room to be a little close.'\r\n\r\n\"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had\r\nbetter proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I\r\nwill take you up to see the machine.'\r\n\r\n\"'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, no, it is in the house.'\r\n\r\n\"'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that.\r\nAll we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us\r\nknow what is wrong with it.'\r\n\r\n\"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the\r\nfat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house,\r\nwith corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little\r\nlow doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the\r\ngenerations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no\r\nsigns of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster\r\nwas peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in\r\ngreen, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an\r\nair as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the\r\nlady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon\r\nmy two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent\r\nman, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at\r\nleast a fellow-countryman.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which\r\nhe unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three\r\nof us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside,\r\nand the colonel ushered me in.\r\n\r\n\"'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and\r\nit would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were\r\nto turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the\r\nend of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of\r\nmany tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns\r\nof water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and\r\nmultiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine\r\ngoes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working\r\nof it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will\r\nhave the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set\r\nit right.'\r\n\r\n\"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very\r\nthoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of\r\nexercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and\r\npressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by\r\nthe whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed\r\na regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An\r\nexamination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was\r\nround the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to\r\nfill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause\r\nof the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who\r\nfollowed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical\r\nquestions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I\r\nhad made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the\r\nmachine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.\r\nIt was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth\r\nwas the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose\r\nthat so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a\r\npurpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a\r\nlarge iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a\r\ncrust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was\r\nscraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a\r\nmuttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the\r\ncolonel looking down at me.\r\n\r\n\"'What are you doing there?' he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as\r\nthat which he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,'\r\nsaid I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to\r\nyour machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it\r\nwas used.'\r\n\r\n\"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of\r\nmy speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in\r\nhis grey eyes.\r\n\r\n\"'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' He\r\ntook a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key\r\nin the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it\r\nwas quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and\r\nshoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'\r\n\r\n\"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my\r\nheart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish\r\nof the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp\r\nstill stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining\r\nthe trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming\r\ndown upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than\r\nmyself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a\r\nshapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and\r\ndragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let\r\nme out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my\r\ncries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with\r\nmy hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it\r\nflashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend\r\nvery much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my\r\nface the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to\r\nthink of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and\r\nyet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black\r\nshadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand\r\nerect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope\r\nback to my heart.\r\n\r\n\"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the\r\nwalls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw\r\na thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which\r\nbroadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For\r\nan instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door\r\nwhich led away from death. The next instant I threw myself\r\nthrough, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had\r\nclosed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few\r\nmoments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me\r\nhow narrow had been my escape.\r\n\r\n\"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and\r\nI found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor,\r\nwhile a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand,\r\nwhile she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend\r\nwhose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\r\n\r\n\"'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a\r\nmoment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste\r\nthe so-precious time, but come!'\r\n\r\n\"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to\r\nmy feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding\r\nstair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we\r\nreached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of\r\ntwo voices, one answering the other from the floor on which  we\r\nwere and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about\r\nher like one  who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door\r\nwhich led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon\r\nwas shining brightly.\r\n\r\n\"'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be\r\nthat you can jump it.'\r\n\r\n\"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the\r\npassage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark\r\nrushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a\r\nbutcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom,\r\nflung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and\r\nwholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be\r\nmore than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I\r\nhesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between\r\nmy saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used,\r\nthen at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance.\r\nThe thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at\r\nthe door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round\r\nhim and tried to hold him back.\r\n\r\n\"'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise\r\nafter the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be\r\nsilent! Oh, he will be silent!'\r\n\r\n\"'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from\r\nher. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me\r\npass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the\r\nwindow, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and\r\nwas hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was\r\nconscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the\r\ngarden below.\r\n\r\n\"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and\r\nrushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I\r\nunderstood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly,\r\nhowever, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.\r\nI glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and\r\nthen, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and\r\nthat the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my\r\nhandkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my\r\nears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the\r\nrose-bushes.\r\n\r\n\"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been\r\na very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was\r\nbreaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with\r\ndew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded\r\nthumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the\r\nparticulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with\r\nthe feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But\r\nto my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house\r\nnor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the\r\nhedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a\r\nlong building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the\r\nvery station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were\r\nit not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed\r\nduring those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\r\n\r\n\"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning\r\ntrain. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The\r\nsame porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I\r\narrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel\r\nLysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a\r\ncarriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was\r\nthere a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three\r\nmiles off.\r\n\r\n\"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined\r\nto wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the\r\npolice. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first\r\nto have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to\r\nbring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do\r\nexactly what you advise.\"\r\n\r\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to\r\nthis extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down\r\nfrom the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he\r\nplaced his cuttings.\r\n\r\n\"Here is an advertisement which will interest you,\" said he. \"It\r\nappeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this:\r\n'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged\r\ntwenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten\r\no'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was\r\ndressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that\r\nthe colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" cried my patient. \"Then that explains what the\r\ngirl said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and\r\ndesperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should\r\nstand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out\r\npirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well,\r\nevery moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall\r\ngo down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for\r\nEyford.\"\r\n\r\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train\r\ntogether, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.\r\nThere were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector\r\nBradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.\r\nBradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the\r\nseat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford\r\nfor its centre.\r\n\r\n\"There you are,\" said he. \"That circle is drawn at a radius of\r\nten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere\r\nnear that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was an hour's good drive.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you\r\nwere unconscious?\"\r\n\r\n\"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having\r\nbeen lifted and conveyed somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I cannot understand,\" said I, \"is why they should have\r\nspared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.\r\nPerhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face\r\nin my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,\" said Bradstreet. \"Well, I\r\nhave drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon\r\nit the folk that we are in search of are to be found.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I could lay my finger on it,\" said Holmes quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Really, now!\" cried the inspector, \"you have formed your\r\nopinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is\r\nsouth, for the country is more deserted there.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I say east,\" said my patient.\r\n\r\n\"I am for west,\" remarked the plain-clothes man. \"There are\r\nseveral quiet little villages up there.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I am for north,\" said I, \"because there are no hills there,\r\nand our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up\r\nany.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" cried the inspector, laughing; \"it's a very pretty\r\ndiversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do\r\nyou give your casting vote to?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are all wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we can't all be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.\" He placed his finger in the\r\ncentre of the circle. \"This is where we shall find them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the twelve-mile drive?\" gasped Hatherley.\r\n\r\n\"Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the\r\nhorse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that\r\nif it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,\" observed Bradstreet\r\nthoughtfully. \"Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature\r\nof this gang.\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all,\" said Holmes. \"They are coiners on a large scale,\r\nand have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the\r\nplace of silver.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,\"\r\nsaid the inspector. \"They have been turning out half-crowns by\r\nthe thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could\r\nget no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that\r\nshowed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this\r\nlucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.\"\r\n\r\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not\r\ndestined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into\r\nEyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed\r\nup from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and\r\nhung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\r\n\r\n\"A house on fire?\" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off\r\nagain on its way.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" said the station-master.\r\n\r\n\"When did it break out?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse,\r\nand the whole place is in a blaze.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose house is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Becher's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" broke in the engineer, \"is Dr. Becher a German, very\r\nthin, with a long, sharp nose?\"\r\n\r\nThe station-master laughed heartily. \"No, sir, Dr. Becher is an\r\nEnglishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a\r\nbetter-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him,\r\na patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as\r\nif a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm.\"\r\n\r\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all\r\nhastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low\r\nhill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in\r\nfront of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in\r\nthe garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to\r\nkeep the flames under.\r\n\r\n\"That's it!\" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. \"There is\r\nthe gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That\r\nsecond window is the one that I jumped from.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, at least,\" said Holmes, \"you have had your revenge upon\r\nthem. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which,\r\nwhen it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls,\r\nthough no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to\r\nobserve it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for\r\nyour friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are\r\na good hundred miles off by now.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this\r\nno word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the\r\nsinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a\r\npeasant had met a cart containing several people and some very\r\nbulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but\r\nthere all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes'\r\ningenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their\r\nwhereabouts.\r\n\r\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements\r\nwhich they had found within, and still more so by discovering a\r\nnewly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.\r\nAbout sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and\r\nthey subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in,\r\nand the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save\r\nsome twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of\r\nthe machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so\r\ndearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored\r\nin an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have\r\nexplained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been\r\nalready referred to.\r\n\r\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to\r\nthe spot where he recovered his senses might have remained\r\nforever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a\r\nvery plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two\r\npersons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other\r\nunusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the\r\nsilent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his\r\ncompanion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out\r\nof the way of danger.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return\r\nonce more to London, \"it has been a pretty business for me! I\r\nhave lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what\r\nhave I gained?\"\r\n\r\n\"Experience,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"Indirectly it may be of\r\nvalue, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the\r\nreputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your\r\nexistence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR\r\n\r\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have\r\nlong ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles\r\nin which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have\r\neclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the\r\ngossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to\r\nbelieve, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to\r\nthe general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a\r\nconsiderable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no\r\nmemoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of\r\nthis remarkable episode.\r\n\r\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I\r\nwas still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came\r\nhome from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table\r\nwaiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather\r\nhad taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and\r\nthe Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as\r\na relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.\r\nWith my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had\r\nsurrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last,\r\nsaturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and\r\nlay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the\r\nenvelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's\r\nnoble correspondent could be.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a very fashionable epistle,\" I remarked as he entered.\r\n\"Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a\r\nfish-monger and a tide-waiter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,\" he\r\nanswered, smiling, \"and the humbler are usually the more\r\ninteresting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social\r\nsummonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.\"\r\n\r\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not social, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, distinctly professional.\"\r\n\r\n\"And from a noble client?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the highest in England.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, I congratulate you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my\r\nclient is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his\r\ncase. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be\r\nwanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the\r\npapers diligently of late, have you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks like it,\" said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in\r\nthe corner. \"I have had nothing else to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I\r\nread nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The\r\nlatter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent\r\nevents so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his\r\nwedding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord\r\nSt. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn\r\nover these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.\r\nThis is what he says:\r\n\r\n\"'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I\r\nmay place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I\r\nhave determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you\r\nin reference to the very painful event which has occurred in\r\nconnection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is\r\nacting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no\r\nobjection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that\r\nit might be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that\r\ntime, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of\r\nparamount importance. Yours faithfully, ST. SIMON.'\r\n\r\n\"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen,\r\nand the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink\r\nupon the outer side of his right little finger,\" remarked Holmes\r\nas he folded up the epistle.\r\n\r\n\"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an\r\nhour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon\r\nthe subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in\r\ntheir order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client\r\nis.\" He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of\r\nreference beside the mantelpiece. \"Here he is,\" said he, sitting\r\ndown and flattening it out upon his knee. \"'Lord Robert Walsingham\r\nde Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms:\r\nAzure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.'\r\nHe's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was\r\nUnder-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The\r\nDuke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs.\r\nThey inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on\r\nthe distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in\r\nall this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something\r\nmore solid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,\" said I,\r\n\"for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as\r\nremarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew\r\nthat you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the\r\nintrusion of other matters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square\r\nfurniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it\r\nwas obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your\r\nnewspaper selections.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal\r\ncolumn of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks\r\nback: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if\r\nrumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert\r\nSt. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty\r\nDoran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San\r\nFrancisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Terse and to the point,\" remarked Holmes, stretching his long,\r\nthin legs towards the fire.\r\n\r\n\"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society\r\npapers of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a\r\ncall for protection in the marriage market, for the present\r\nfree-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home\r\nproduct. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great\r\nBritain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across\r\nthe Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last\r\nweek to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by\r\nthese charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself\r\nfor over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has\r\nnow definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty\r\nDoran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss\r\nDoran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much\r\nattention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child,\r\nand it is currently reported that her dowry will run to\r\nconsiderably over the six figures, with expectancies for the\r\nfuture. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has\r\nbeen compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years,\r\nand as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small\r\nestate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress\r\nis not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to\r\nmake the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a\r\nBritish peeress.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything else?\" asked Holmes, yawning.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post\r\nto say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it\r\nwould be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen\r\nintimate friends would be invited, and that the party would\r\nreturn to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been\r\ntaken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on\r\nWednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had\r\ntaken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord\r\nBackwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices\r\nwhich appeared before the disappearance of the bride.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before the what?\" asked Holmes with a start.\r\n\r\n\"The vanishing of the lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did she vanish, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the wedding breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite\r\ndramatic, in fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.\"\r\n\r\n\"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during\r\nthe honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt\r\nas this. Pray let me have the details.\"\r\n\r\n\"I warn you that they are very incomplete.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we may make them less so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a\r\nmorning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is\r\nheaded, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':\r\n\r\n\"'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the\r\ngreatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which\r\nhave taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as\r\nshortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the\r\nprevious morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to\r\nconfirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently\r\nfloating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush\r\nthe matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it\r\nthat no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what\r\nis a common subject for conversation.\r\n\r\n\"'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover\r\nSquare, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the\r\nfather of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral,\r\nLord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the\r\nyounger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia\r\nWhittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of\r\nMr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been\r\nprepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a\r\nwoman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to\r\nforce her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging\r\nthat she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a\r\npainful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler\r\nand the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house\r\nbefore this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast\r\nwith the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and\r\nretired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some\r\ncomment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that\r\nshe had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an\r\nulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the\r\nfootmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus\r\napparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress,\r\nbelieving her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his\r\ndaughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with\r\nthe bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with\r\nthe police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which\r\nwill probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very\r\nsingular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing\r\nhad transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There\r\nare rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the\r\npolice have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the\r\noriginal disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some\r\nother motive, she may have been concerned in the strange\r\ndisappearance of the bride.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And is that all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is\r\na suggestive one.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is--\"\r\n\r\n\"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance,\r\nhas actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a\r\ndanseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom\r\nfor some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole\r\ncase is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the\r\npublic press.\"\r\n\r\n\"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would\r\nnot have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell,\r\nWatson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I\r\nhave no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not\r\ndream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness,\r\nif only as a check to my own memory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord Robert St. Simon,\" announced our page-boy, throwing open\r\nthe door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face,\r\nhigh-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about\r\nthe mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose\r\npleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His\r\nmanner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue\r\nimpression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little\r\nbend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off\r\nhis very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin\r\nupon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of\r\nfoppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat,\r\nyellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters.\r\nHe advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to\r\nright, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his\r\ngolden eyeglasses.\r\n\r\n\"Good-day, Lord St. Simon,\" said Holmes, rising and bowing. \"Pray\r\ntake the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\r\nWatson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this\r\nmatter over.\"\r\n\r\n\"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine,\r\nMr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you\r\nhave already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,\r\nthough I presume that they were hardly from the same class of\r\nsociety.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I am descending.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg pardon.\"\r\n\r\n\"My last client of the sort was a king.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?\"\r\n\r\n\"The King of Scandinavia.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Had he lost his wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can understand,\" said Holmes suavely, \"that I extend to the\r\naffairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to\r\nyou in yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to\r\nmy own case, I am ready to give you any information which may\r\nassist you in forming an opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public\r\nprints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this\r\narticle, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.\"\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. \"Yes, it is correct, as far as it\r\ngoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could\r\noffer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most\r\ndirectly by questioning you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?\"\r\n\r\n\"In San Francisco, a year ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were travelling in the States?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you become engaged then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you were on a friendly footing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was\r\namused.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her father is very rich?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how did he make his money?\"\r\n\r\n\"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,\r\ninvested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your\r\nwife's character?\"\r\n\r\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down\r\ninto the fire. \"You see, Mr. Holmes,\" said he, \"my wife was\r\ntwenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she\r\nran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or\r\nmountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than\r\nfrom the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy,\r\nwith a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of\r\ntraditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She\r\nis swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her\r\nresolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the\r\nname which I have the honour to bear\"--he gave a little stately\r\ncough--\"had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I\r\nbelieve that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that\r\nanything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you her photograph?\"\r\n\r\n\"I brought this with me.\" He opened a locket and showed us the\r\nfull face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an\r\nivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect\r\nof the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the\r\nexquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he\r\nclosed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\r\n\r\n\"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your\r\nacquaintance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I\r\nmet her several times, became engaged to her, and have now\r\nmarried her.\"\r\n\r\n\"She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?\"\r\n\r\n\"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a\r\nfait accompli?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really have made no inquiries on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the\r\nwedding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was she in good spirits?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our\r\nfuture lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the\r\nwedding?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the\r\nceremony.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you observe any change in her then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had\r\never seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident\r\nhowever, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible\r\nbearing upon the case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray let us have it, for all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards\r\nthe vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it\r\nfell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the\r\ngentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not\r\nappear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of\r\nthe matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our\r\nway home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of\r\nthe general public were present, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is\r\nopen.\"\r\n\r\n\"This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a\r\ncommon-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But\r\nreally I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less\r\ncheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do\r\non re-entering her father's house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw her in conversation with her maid.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is her maid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California\r\nwith her.\"\r\n\r\n\"A confidential servant?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed\r\nher to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they\r\nlook upon these things in a different way.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long did she speak to this Alice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not overhear what they said?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was\r\naccustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she\r\nmeant.\"\r\n\r\n\"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your\r\nwife do when she finished speaking to her maid?\"\r\n\r\n\"She walked into the breakfast-room.\"\r\n\r\n\"On your arm?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that.\r\nThen, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose\r\nhurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She\r\nnever came back.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to\r\nher room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a\r\nbonnet, and went out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in\r\ncompany with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who\r\nhad already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady,\r\nand your relations to her.\"\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.\r\n\"We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on\r\na very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have\r\nnot treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of\r\ncomplaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes.\r\nFlora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and\r\ndevotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she\r\nheard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the\r\nreason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I\r\nfeared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to\r\nMr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to\r\npush her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my\r\nwife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the\r\npossibility of something of the sort, and I had two police\r\nfellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.\r\nShe was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a\r\nrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did your wife hear all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank goodness, she did not.\"\r\n\r\n\"And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as\r\nso serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid\r\nsome terrible trap for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is a possible supposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon\r\nthis as likely?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray\r\nwhat is your own theory as to what took place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I\r\nhave given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may\r\nsay that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of\r\nthis affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a\r\nsocial stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous\r\ndisturbance in my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I\r\nwill not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to\r\nwithout success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,\" said\r\nHolmes, smiling. \"And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have\r\nnearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the\r\nbreakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?\"\r\n\r\n\"We could see the other side of the road and the Park.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.\r\nI shall communicate with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,\" said our\r\nclient, rising.\r\n\r\n\"I have solved it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh? What was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say that I have solved it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where, then, is my wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\"\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon shook his head. \"I am afraid that it will take\r\nwiser heads than yours or mine,\" he remarked, and bowing in a\r\nstately, old-fashioned manner he departed.\r\n\r\n\"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting\r\nit on a level with his own,\" said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \"I\r\nthink that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all\r\nthis cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the\r\ncase before our client came into the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I\r\nremarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination\r\nserved to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial\r\nevidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a\r\ntrout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have heard all that you have heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which\r\nserves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some\r\nyears back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich\r\nthe year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these\r\ncases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade!\r\nYou will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are\r\ncigars in the box.\"\r\n\r\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat,\r\nwhich gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a\r\nblack canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated\r\nhimself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.\r\n\r\n\"What's up, then?\" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. \"You\r\nlook dissatisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage\r\ncase. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really! You surprise me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip\r\nthrough my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And very wet it seems to have made you,\" said Holmes laying his\r\nhand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.\"\r\n\r\n\"In heaven's name, what for?\"\r\n\r\n\"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Why? What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in\r\nthe one as in the other.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. \"I suppose you\r\nknow all about it,\" he snarled.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in\r\nthe matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it very unlikely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found\r\nthis in it?\" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the\r\nfloor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin\r\nshoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked\r\nin water. \"There,\" said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the\r\ntop of the pile. \"There is a little nut for you to crack, Master\r\nHolmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.\r\n\"You dragged them from the Serpentine?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.\r\nThey have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me\r\nthat if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found\r\nin the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope\r\nto arrive at through this?\"\r\n\r\n\"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that you will find it difficult.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you, indeed, now?\" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. \"I\r\nam afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your\r\ndeductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as\r\nmany minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the\r\ncard-case is a note. And here is the very note.\" He slapped it\r\ndown upon the table in front of him. \"Listen to this: 'You will\r\nsee me when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.' Now my theory all\r\nalong has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora\r\nMillar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was\r\nresponsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her\r\ninitials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped\r\ninto her hand at the door and which lured her within their\r\nreach.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Lestrade,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"You really are\r\nvery fine indeed. Let me see it.\" He took up the paper in a\r\nlistless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he\r\ngave a little cry of satisfaction. \"This is indeed important,\"\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! you find it so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. \"Why,\" he\r\nshrieked, \"you're looking at the wrong side!\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, this is the right side.\"\r\n\r\n\"The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil\r\nover here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel\r\nbill, which interests me deeply.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before,\" said Lestrade.\r\n\"'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s.\r\n6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the\r\nnote, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I\r\ncongratulate you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've wasted time enough,\" said Lestrade, rising. \"I believe in\r\nhard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.\r\nGood-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom\r\nof the matter first.\" He gathered up the garments, thrust them\r\ninto the bag, and made for the door.\r\n\r\n\"Just one hint to you, Lestrade,\" drawled Holmes before his rival\r\nvanished; \"I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady\r\nSt. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any\r\nsuch person.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me,\r\ntapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and\r\nhurried away.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on\r\nhis overcoat. \"There is something in what the fellow says about\r\noutdoor work,\" he remarked, \"so I think, Watson, that I must\r\nleave you to your papers for a little.\"\r\n\r\nIt was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had\r\nno time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a\r\nconfectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked\r\nwith the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and\r\npresently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean\r\nlittle cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble\r\nlodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold\r\nwoodcock, a pheasant, a p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras pie with a group of\r\nancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries,\r\nmy two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian\r\nNights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid\r\nfor and were ordered to this address.\r\n\r\nJust before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the\r\nroom. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his\r\neye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n\"They have laid the supper, then,\" he said, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,\" said he. \"I\r\nam surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I\r\nfancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,\r\ndangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very\r\nperturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\r\n\r\n\"My messenger reached you, then?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.\r\nHave you good authority for what you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"The best possible.\"\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\"What will the Duke say,\" he murmured, \"when he hears that one of\r\nthe family has been subjected to such humiliation?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any\r\nhumiliation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the\r\nlady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of\r\ndoing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she\r\nhad no one to advise her at such a crisis.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a slight, sir, a public slight,\" said Lord St. Simon,\r\ntapping his fingers upon the table.\r\n\r\n\"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so\r\nunprecedented a position.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have\r\nbeen shamefully used.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that I heard a ring,\" said Holmes. \"Yes, there are steps\r\non the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view\r\nof the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here\r\nwho may be more successful.\" He opened the door and ushered in a\r\nlady and gentleman. \"Lord St. Simon,\" said he \"allow me to\r\nintroduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I\r\nthink, you have already met.\"\r\n\r\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his\r\nseat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand\r\nthrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended\r\ndignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out\r\nher hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was\r\nas well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was\r\none which it was hard to resist.\r\n\r\n\"You're angry, Robert,\" said she. \"Well, I guess you have every\r\ncause to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray make no apology to me,\" said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I\r\nshould have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of\r\nrattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just\r\ndidn't know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't\r\nfall down and do a faint right there before the altar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave\r\nthe room while you explain this matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I may give an opinion,\" remarked the strange gentleman,\r\n\"we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business\r\nalready. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to\r\nhear the rights of it.\" He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man,\r\nclean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll tell our story right away,\" said the lady. \"Frank here\r\nand I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where pa\r\nwas working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I;\r\nbut then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile,\r\nwhile poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to\r\nnothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa\r\nwouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took\r\nme away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so\r\nhe followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything\r\nabout it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just\r\nfixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and\r\nmake his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had\r\nas much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of\r\ntime and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived.\r\n'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and\r\nthen I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your\r\nhusband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had\r\nfixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting,\r\nthat we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek\r\nhis fortune, and I went back to pa.\r\n\r\n\"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then\r\nhe went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New\r\nMexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a\r\nminers' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was\r\nmy Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was\r\nvery sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took\r\nme to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a\r\nyear and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really\r\ndead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London,\r\nand a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt\r\nall the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place\r\nin my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done\r\nmy duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our\r\nactions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make\r\nhim just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may\r\nimagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I\r\nglanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the\r\nfirst pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked\r\nagain there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as\r\nif to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I\r\ndidn't drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the\r\nwords of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my\r\near. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the service and make\r\na scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to\r\nknow what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to\r\ntell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper,\r\nand I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on\r\nthe way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the\r\nnote into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a\r\nline asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.\r\nOf course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now\r\nto him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\r\n\r\n\"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California,\r\nand had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but\r\nto get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to\r\nhave spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before\r\nhis mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to\r\nrun away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table ten\r\nminutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of\r\nthe road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park.\r\nI slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman\r\ncame talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to\r\nme--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little\r\nsecret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away\r\nfrom her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and\r\naway we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and\r\nthat was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank\r\nhad been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to\r\n'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to\r\nEngland, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the\r\nvery morning of my second wedding.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw it in a paper,\" explained the American. \"It gave the name\r\nand the church but not where the lady lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all\r\nfor openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I\r\nshould like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just\r\nsending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It\r\nwas awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting\r\nround that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So\r\nFrank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of\r\nthem, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away\r\nsomewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we\r\nshould have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good\r\ngentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how\r\nhe found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very\r\nclearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and\r\nthat we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so\r\nsecret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord\r\nSt. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at\r\nonce. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if\r\nI have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very\r\nmeanly of me.\"\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but\r\nhad listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this\r\nlong narrative.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" he said, \"but it is not my custom to discuss my most\r\nintimate personal affairs in this public manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.\" He put out\r\nhis hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\r\n\r\n\"I had hoped,\" suggested Holmes, \"that you would have joined us\r\nin a friendly supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that there you ask a little too much,\" responded his\r\nLordship. \"I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent\r\ndevelopments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over\r\nthem. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a\r\nvery good-night.\" He included us all in a sweeping bow and\r\nstalked out of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your\r\ncompany,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"It is always a joy to meet an\r\nAmerican, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the\r\nfolly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone\r\nyears will not prevent our children from being some day citizens\r\nof the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a\r\nquartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The case has been an interesting one,\" remarked Holmes when our\r\nvisitors had left us, \"because it serves to show very clearly how\r\nsimple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight\r\nseems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural\r\nthan the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing\r\nstranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr.\r\nLestrade of Scotland Yard.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that\r\nthe lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony,\r\nthe other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of\r\nreturning home. Obviously something had occurred during the\r\nmorning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that\r\nsomething be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was\r\nout, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she\r\nseen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America\r\nbecause she had spent so short a time in this country that she\r\ncould hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence\r\nover her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change\r\nher plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a\r\nprocess of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an\r\nAmerican. Then who could this American be, and why should he\r\npossess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might\r\nbe a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in\r\nrough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got\r\nbefore I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us\r\nof a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so\r\ntransparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a\r\nbouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very\r\nsignificant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance\r\nmeans taking possession of that which another person has a prior\r\nclaim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had\r\ngone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a\r\nprevious husband--the chances being in favour of the latter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how in the world did you find them?\"\r\n\r\n\"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held\r\ninformation in his hands the value of which he did not himself\r\nknow. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance,\r\nbut more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had\r\nsettled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you deduce the select?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence\r\nfor a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive\r\nhotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate.\r\nIn the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I\r\nlearned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an\r\nAmerican gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking\r\nover the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I\r\nhad seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded\r\nto 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate\r\nenough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them\r\nsome paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be\r\nbetter in every way that they should make their position a little\r\nclearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in\r\nparticular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I\r\nmade him keep the appointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"But with no very good result,\" I remarked. \"His conduct was\r\ncertainly not very gracious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Watson,\" said Holmes, smiling, \"perhaps you would not be\r\nvery gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and\r\nwedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of\r\nfortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully\r\nand thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in\r\nthe same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for\r\nthe only problem we have still to solve is how to while away\r\nthese bleak autumnal evenings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET\r\n\r\n\"Holmes,\" said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking\r\ndown the street, \"here is a madman coming along. It seems rather\r\nsad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands\r\nin the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It\r\nwas a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day\r\nbefore still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the\r\nwintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed\r\ninto a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and\r\non the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as\r\nwhen it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but\r\nwas still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer\r\npassengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the\r\nMetropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman\r\nwhose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a\r\nmassive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was\r\ndressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining\r\nhat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet\r\nhis actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress\r\nand features, for he was running hard, with occasional little\r\nsprings, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to\r\nset any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and\r\ndown, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most\r\nextraordinary contortions.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth can be the matter with him?\" I asked. \"He is\r\nlooking up at the numbers of the houses.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that he is coming here,\" said Holmes, rubbing his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"Here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I\r\nthink that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?\" As\r\nhe spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and\r\npulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the\r\nclanging.\r\n\r\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still\r\ngesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in\r\nhis eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and\r\npity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his\r\nbody and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the\r\nextreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his\r\nfeet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we\r\nboth rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room.\r\nSherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting\r\nbeside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy,\r\nsoothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\r\n\r\n\"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?\" said he.\r\n\"You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have\r\nrecovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into\r\nany little problem which you may submit to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting\r\nagainst his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his\r\nbrow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt you think me mad?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I see that you have had some great trouble,\" responded Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my\r\nreason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might\r\nhave faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet\r\nborne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man;\r\nbut the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have\r\nbeen enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone.\r\nThe very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found\r\nout of this horrible affair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray compose yourself, sir,\" said Holmes, \"and let me have a\r\nclear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name,\" answered our visitor, \"is probably familiar to your\r\nears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &\r\nStevenson, of Threadneedle Street.\"\r\n\r\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior\r\npartner in the second largest private banking concern in the City\r\nof London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the\r\nforemost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We\r\nwaited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced\r\nhimself to tell his story.\r\n\r\n\"I feel that time is of value,\" said he; \"that is why I hastened\r\nhere when the police inspector suggested that I should secure\r\nyour co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and\r\nhurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this\r\nsnow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who\r\ntakes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the\r\nfacts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\r\n\r\n\"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking\r\nbusiness as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative\r\ninvestments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection\r\nand the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means\r\nof laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security\r\nis unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction\r\nduring the last few years, and there are many noble families to\r\nwhom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their\r\npictures, libraries, or plate.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a\r\ncard was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I\r\nsaw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps\r\neven to you I had better say no more than that it was a name\r\nwhich is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest,\r\nnoblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the\r\nhonour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged\r\nat once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry\r\nquickly through a disagreeable task.\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in the\r\nhabit of advancing money.'\r\n\r\n\"'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.\r\n\r\n\"'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have\r\n50,000 pounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a\r\nsum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it\r\na matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my\r\nposition you can readily understand that it is unwise to place\r\none's self under obligations.'\r\n\r\n\"'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most\r\ncertainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you\r\nthink it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the\r\nmoney should be paid at once.'\r\n\r\n\"'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my\r\nown private purse,' said I, 'were it not that the strain would be\r\nrather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do\r\nit in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must\r\ninsist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution\r\nshould be taken.'\r\n\r\n\"'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raising up a\r\nsquare, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair.\r\n'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?'\r\n\r\n\"'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,'\r\nsaid I.\r\n\r\n\"'Precisely.' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,\r\nflesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery\r\nwhich he had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said\r\nhe, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The\r\nlowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the\r\nsum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my\r\nsecurity.'\r\n\r\n\"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some\r\nperplexity from it to my illustrious client.\r\n\r\n\"'You doubt its value?' he asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Not at all. I only doubt--'\r\n\r\n\"'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest\r\nabout that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely\r\ncertain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a\r\npure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?'\r\n\r\n\"'Ample.'\r\n\r\n\"'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof\r\nof the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I\r\nhave heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to\r\nrefrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to\r\npreserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I\r\nneed not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any\r\nharm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as\r\nserious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the\r\nworld to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them.\r\nI leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall\r\ncall for it in person on Monday morning.'\r\n\r\n\"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,\r\ncalling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000\r\npound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the\r\nprecious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not\r\nbut think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility\r\nwhich it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it\r\nwas a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any\r\nmisfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever\r\nconsented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter\r\nthe matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned\r\nonce more to my work.\r\n\r\n\"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave\r\nso precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes had\r\nbeen forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how\r\nterrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I\r\ndetermined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always\r\ncarry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might\r\nnever be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a\r\ncab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel\r\nwith me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs\r\nand locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.\r\n\r\n\"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to\r\nthoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep\r\nout of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three\r\nmaid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose\r\nabsolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy\r\nParr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few\r\nmonths. She came with an excellent character, however, and has\r\nalways given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has\r\nattracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place.\r\nThat is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we\r\nbelieve her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\r\n\r\n\"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it\r\nwill not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an\r\nonly son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr.\r\nHolmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am\r\nmyself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very\r\nlikely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I\r\nhad to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a\r\nmoment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it\r\nwould have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I\r\nmeant it for the best.\r\n\r\n\"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my\r\nbusiness, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild,\r\nwayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the\r\nhandling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a\r\nmember of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming\r\nmanners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long\r\npurses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards\r\nand to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again\r\nto come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his\r\nallowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried\r\nmore than once to break away from the dangerous company which he\r\nwas keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir\r\nGeorge Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\r\n\r\n\"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George\r\nBurnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently\r\nbrought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could\r\nhardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than\r\nArthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been\r\neverywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of\r\ngreat personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far\r\naway from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his\r\ncynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that\r\nhe is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so,\r\ntoo, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but\r\nwhen my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the\r\nworld I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my\r\ndaughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful,\r\na wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and\r\ngentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know\r\nwhat I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone\r\nagainst my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for\r\nhe loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I\r\nthink that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it\r\nwould have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his\r\nwhole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and\r\nI shall continue with my miserable story.\r\n\r\n\"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after\r\ndinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious\r\ntreasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name\r\nof my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am\r\nsure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.\r\nMary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous\r\ncoronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\r\n\r\n\"'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"'In my own bureau.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the\r\nnight.' said he.\r\n\r\n\"'It is locked up,' I answered.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I\r\nhave opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'\r\n\r\n\"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of\r\nwhat he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with\r\na very grave face.\r\n\r\n\"'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let\r\nme have 200 pounds?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too\r\ngenerous with you in money matters.'\r\n\r\n\"'You have been very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this money,\r\nor else I can never show my face inside the club again.'\r\n\r\n\"'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,'\r\nsaid he. 'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money\r\nin some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try\r\nother means.'\r\n\r\n\"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the\r\nmonth. 'You shall not have a farthing from me,' I cried, on which\r\nhe bowed and left the room without another word.\r\n\r\n\"When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my\r\ntreasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go\r\nround the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I\r\nusually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform\r\nmyself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself\r\nat the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as\r\nI approached.\r\n\r\n\"'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little\r\ndisturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out\r\nto-night?'\r\n\r\n\"'Certainly not.'\r\n\r\n\"'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she\r\nhas only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that\r\nit is hardly safe and should be stopped.'\r\n\r\n\"'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer\r\nit. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'\r\n\r\n\"'Quite sure, dad.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom\r\nagain, where I was soon asleep.\r\n\r\n\"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may\r\nhave any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question\r\nme upon any point which I do not make clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be\r\nparticularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety\r\nin my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.\r\nAbout two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in\r\nthe house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an\r\nimpression behind it as though a window had gently closed\r\nsomewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my\r\nhorror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in\r\nthe next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear,\r\nand peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\r\n\r\n\"'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you\r\ntouch that coronet?'\r\n\r\n\"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,\r\ndressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the\r\nlight, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be\r\nwrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry\r\nhe dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I\r\nsnatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with\r\nthree of the beryls in it, was missing.\r\n\r\n\"'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have\r\ndestroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the\r\njewels which you have stolen?'\r\n\r\n\"'Stolen!' he cried.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.\r\n\r\n\"'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I\r\ncall you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to\r\ntear off another piece?'\r\n\r\n\"'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it\r\nany longer. I shall not say another word about this business,\r\nsince you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in\r\nthe morning and make my own way in the world.'\r\n\r\n\"'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried\r\nhalf-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to\r\nthe bottom.'\r\n\r\n\"'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such\r\nas I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to\r\ncall the police, let the police find what they can.'\r\n\r\n\"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my\r\nvoice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and,\r\nat the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the\r\nwhole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the\r\nground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the\r\ninvestigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a\r\nconstable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with\r\nhis arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge\r\nhim with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private\r\nmatter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was\r\nnational property. I was determined that the law should have its\r\nway in everything.\r\n\r\n\"'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It\r\nwould be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the\r\nhouse for five minutes.'\r\n\r\n\"'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you\r\nhave stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position\r\nin which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only\r\nmy honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at\r\nstake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would\r\nconvulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell\r\nme what he had done with the three missing stones.\r\n\r\n\"'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught\r\nin the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.\r\nIf you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling\r\nus where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'\r\n\r\n\"'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered,\r\nturning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened\r\nfor any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for\r\nit. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search\r\nwas made at once not only of his person but of his room and of\r\nevery portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed\r\nthe gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the\r\nwretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our\r\nthreats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after\r\ngoing through all the police formalities, have hurried round to\r\nyou to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter.\r\nThe police have openly confessed that they can at present make\r\nnothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think\r\nnecessary. I have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My\r\nGod, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son\r\nin one night. Oh, what shall I do!\"\r\n\r\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to\r\nand fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got\r\nbeyond words.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows\r\nknitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Do you receive much company?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of\r\nArthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No\r\none else, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you go out much in society?\"\r\n\r\n\"Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is unusual in a young girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She\r\nis four-and-twenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to\r\nher also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Terrible! She is even more affected than I.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet\r\nin his hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of\r\nthe coronet at all injured?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was twisted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to\r\nstraighten it?\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me.\r\nBut it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If\r\nhis purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?\r\nHis silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several\r\nsingular points about the case. What did the police think of the\r\nnoise which awoke you from your sleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his\r\nbedroom door.\"\r\n\r\n\"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door\r\nso as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the\r\ndisappearance of these gems?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture\r\nin the hope of finding them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they thought of looking outside the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has\r\nalready been minutely examined.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, my dear sir,\" said Holmes, \"is it not obvious to you now\r\nthat this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you\r\nor the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you\r\nto be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider\r\nwhat is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came\r\ndown from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room,\r\nopened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main\r\nforce a small portion of it, went off to some other place,\r\nconcealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that\r\nnobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six\r\ninto the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger\r\nof being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?\"\r\n\r\n\"But what other is there?\" cried the banker with a gesture of\r\ndespair. \"If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is our task to find that out,\" replied Holmes; \"so now, if\r\nyou please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together,\r\nand devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into\r\ndetails.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,\r\nwhich I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy\r\nwere deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I\r\nconfess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be\r\nas obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such\r\nfaith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some\r\ngrounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted\r\nexplanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the\r\nsouthern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his\r\nhat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client\r\nappeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope\r\nwhich had been presented to him, and he even broke into a\r\ndesultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway\r\njourney and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest\r\nresidence of the great financier.\r\n\r\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing\r\nback a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a\r\nsnow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates\r\nwhich closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden\r\nthicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges\r\nstretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the\r\ntradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the\r\nstables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a\r\npublic, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing\r\nat the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the\r\nfront, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden\r\nbehind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I\r\nwent into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should\r\nreturn. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and\r\na young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height,\r\nslim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against\r\nthe absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever\r\nseen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were\r\nbloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept\r\nsilently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of\r\ngrief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the\r\nmore striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong\r\ncharacter, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding\r\nmy presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand\r\nover his head with a sweet womanly caress.\r\n\r\n\"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you\r\nnot, dad?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman's\r\ninstincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will\r\nbe sorry for having acted so harshly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should\r\nsuspect him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with\r\nthe coronet in his hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take\r\nmy word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say\r\nno more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in\r\nprison!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary!\r\nYour affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences\r\nto me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman\r\ndown from London to inquire more deeply into it.\"\r\n\r\n\"This gentleman?\" she asked, facing round to me.\r\n\r\n\"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in\r\nthe stable lane now.\"\r\n\r\n\"The stable lane?\" She raised her dark eyebrows. \"What can he\r\nhope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir,\r\nthat you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth,\r\nthat my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may\r\nprove it,\" returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the\r\nsnow from his shoes. \"I believe I have the honour of addressing\r\nMiss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard nothing yourself last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard\r\nthat, and I came down.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you\r\nfasten all the windows?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were they all fastened this morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked\r\nto your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and\r\nwho may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her\r\nsweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is the good of all these vague theories,\" cried the\r\nbanker impatiently, \"when I have told you that I saw Arthur with\r\nthe coronet in his hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this\r\ngirl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I\r\npresume?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I\r\nmet her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round.\r\nHis name is Francis Prosper.\"\r\n\r\n\"He stood,\" said Holmes, \"to the left of the door--that is to\r\nsay, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he did.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he is a man with a wooden leg?\"\r\n\r\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive\r\nblack eyes. \"Why, you are like a magician,\" said she. \"How do you\r\nknow that?\" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in\r\nHolmes' thin, eager face.\r\n\r\n\"I should be very glad now to go upstairs,\" said he. \"I shall\r\nprobably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps\r\nI had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at\r\nthe large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.\r\nThis he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill\r\nwith his powerful magnifying lens. \"Now we shall go upstairs,\"\r\nsaid he at last.\r\n\r\nThe banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little\r\nchamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.\r\nHolmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\r\n\r\n\"Which key was used to open it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the\r\nlumber-room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you it here?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is it on the dressing-table.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\r\n\r\n\"It is a noiseless lock,\" said he. \"It is no wonder that it did\r\nnot wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must\r\nhave a look at it.\" He opened the case, and taking out the diadem\r\nhe laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the\r\njeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I\r\nhave ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge,\r\nwhere a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Holder,\" said Holmes, \"here is the corner which\r\ncorresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I\r\nbeg that you will break it off.\"\r\n\r\nThe banker recoiled in horror. \"I should not dream of trying,\"\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\n\"Then I will.\" Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but\r\nwithout result. \"I feel it give a little,\" said he; \"but, though\r\nI am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my\r\ntime to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do\r\nyou think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would\r\nbe a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this\r\nhappened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard\r\nnothing of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think,\r\nMiss Holder?\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary\r\nluck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault\r\nif we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your\r\npermission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations\r\noutside.\"\r\n\r\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any\r\nunnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an\r\nhour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet\r\nheavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.\r\n\r\n\"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.\r\nHolder,\" said he; \"I can serve you best by returning to my\r\nrooms.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell.\"\r\n\r\nThe banker wrung his hands. \"I shall never see them again!\" he\r\ncried. \"And my son? You give me hopes?\"\r\n\r\n\"My opinion is in no way altered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was\r\nacted in my house last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow\r\nmorning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to\r\nmake it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to\r\nact for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you\r\nplace no limit on the sum I may draw.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would give my fortune to have them back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.\r\nGood-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here\r\nagain before evening.\"\r\n\r\nIt was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up\r\nabout the case, although what his conclusions were was more than\r\nI could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward\r\njourney I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always\r\nglided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in\r\ndespair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our\r\nrooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in\r\na few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned\r\nup, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he\r\nwas a perfect sample of the class.\r\n\r\n\"I think that this should do,\" said he, glancing into the glass\r\nabove the fireplace. \"I only wish that you could come with me,\r\nWatson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in\r\nthis matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I\r\nshall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few\r\nhours.\" He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard,\r\nsandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this\r\nrude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.\r\n\r\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in\r\nexcellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his\r\nhand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a\r\ncup of tea.\r\n\r\n\"I only looked in as I passed,\" said he. \"I am going right on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time\r\nbefore I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be\r\nlate.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you getting on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham\r\nsince I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a\r\nvery sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a\r\ngood deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get\r\nthese disreputable clothes off and return to my highly\r\nrespectable self.\"\r\n\r\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for\r\nsatisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled,\r\nand there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He\r\nhastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of\r\nthe hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his\r\ncongenial hunt.\r\n\r\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so\r\nI retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away\r\nfor days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that\r\nhis lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he\r\ncame in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there\r\nhe was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the\r\nother, as fresh and trim as possible.\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,\" said he, \"but\r\nyou remember that our client has rather an early appointment this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it is after nine now,\" I answered. \"I should not be\r\nsurprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the\r\nchange which had come over him, for his face which was naturally\r\nof a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in,\r\nwhile his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered\r\nwith a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than\r\nhis violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into\r\nthe armchair which I pushed forward for him.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,\" said\r\nhe. \"Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without\r\na care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured\r\nage. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece,\r\nMary, has deserted me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deserted you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was\r\nempty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to\r\nher last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had\r\nmarried my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was\r\nthoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers\r\nin this note:\r\n\r\n\"'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,\r\nand that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune\r\nmight never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my\r\nmind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must\r\nleave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is\r\nprovided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will\r\nbe fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in\r\ndeath, I am ever your loving,--MARY.'\r\n\r\n\"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it\r\npoints to suicide?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible\r\nsolution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of\r\nyour troubles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have\r\nlearned something! Where are the gems?\"\r\n\r\n\"You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would pay ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter.\r\nAnd there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book?\r\nHere is a pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds.\"\r\n\r\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes\r\nwalked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of\r\ngold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\r\n\r\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\r\n\r\n\"You have it!\" he gasped. \"I am saved! I am saved!\"\r\n\r\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and\r\nhe hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\r\n\r\n\"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,\" said Sherlock\r\nHolmes rather sternly.\r\n\r\n\"Owe!\" He caught up a pen. \"Name the sum, and I will pay it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that\r\nnoble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I\r\nshould be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to\r\nhave one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it was not Arthur who took them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him\r\nknow that the truth is known.\"\r\n\r\n\"He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an\r\ninterview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the\r\nstory, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was\r\nright and to add the very few details which were not yet quite\r\nclear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his\r\nlips.\"\r\n\r\n\"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary\r\nmystery!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached\r\nit. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me\r\nto say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding\r\nbetween Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now\r\nfled together.\"\r\n\r\n\"My Mary? Impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither\r\nyou nor your son knew the true character of this man when you\r\nadmitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most\r\ndangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely\r\ndesperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece\r\nknew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he\r\nhad done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she\r\nalone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said,\r\nbut at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing\r\nhim nearly every evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!\" cried the banker with an\r\nashen face.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.\r\nYour niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room,\r\nslipped down and talked to her lover through the window which\r\nleads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right\r\nthrough the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the\r\ncoronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he\r\nbent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but\r\nthere are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all\r\nother loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had\r\nhardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\r\ndownstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you\r\nabout one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover,\r\nwhich was all perfectly true.\r\n\r\n\"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but\r\nhe slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.\r\nIn the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door,\r\nso he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin\r\nwalking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared\r\ninto your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad\r\nslipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what\r\nwould come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the\r\nroom again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw\r\nthat she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed\r\ndown the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and\r\nslipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see\r\nwhat passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the\r\nwindow, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then\r\nclosing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close\r\nto where he stood hid behind the curtain.\r\n\r\n\"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action\r\nwithout a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the\r\ninstant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune\r\nthis would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it\r\nright. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened\r\nthe window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,\r\nwhere he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George\r\nBurnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was\r\na struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the\r\ncoronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son\r\nstruck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something\r\nsuddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet\r\nin his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your\r\nroom, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in\r\nthe struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you\r\nappeared upon the scene.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible?\" gasped the banker.\r\n\r\n\"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when\r\nhe felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not\r\nexplain the true state of affairs without betraying one who\r\ncertainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He\r\ntook the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her\r\nsecret.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the\r\ncoronet,\" cried Mr. Holder. \"Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have\r\nbeen! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!\r\nThe dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the\r\nscene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!\"\r\n\r\n\"When I arrived at the house,\" continued Holmes, \"I at once went\r\nvery carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in\r\nthe snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since\r\nthe evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost\r\nto preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but\r\nfound it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it,\r\nhowever, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood\r\nand talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed\r\nthat he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been\r\ndisturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was\r\nshown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had\r\nwaited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time\r\nthat this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had\r\nalready spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed\r\nround the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,\r\nwhich I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable\r\nlane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in\r\nfront of me.\r\n\r\n\"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second\r\ndouble line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked\r\nfeet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the\r\nlatter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the\r\nother had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over\r\nthe depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed\r\nafter the other. I followed them up and found they led to the\r\nhall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while\r\nwaiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred\r\nyards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round,\r\nwhere the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,\r\nand, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me\r\nthat I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and\r\nanother little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been\r\nhurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that\r\nthe pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\r\n\r\n\"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the\r\nsill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could\r\nat once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the\r\noutline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming\r\nin. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what\r\nhad occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had\r\nbrought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had\r\npursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged\r\nat the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which\r\nneither alone could have effected. He had returned with the\r\nprize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So\r\nfar I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who\r\nwas it brought him the coronet?\r\n\r\n\"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the\r\nimpossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the\r\ntruth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down,\r\nso there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were\r\nthe maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in\r\ntheir place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his\r\ncousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should\r\nretain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful\r\none. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and\r\nhow she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture\r\nbecame a certainty.\r\n\r\n\"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently,\r\nfor who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must\r\nfeel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your\r\ncircle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir\r\nGeorge Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil\r\nreputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots\r\nand retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur\r\nhad discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was\r\nsafe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his\r\nown family.\r\n\r\n\"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took\r\nnext. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house,\r\nmanaged to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that\r\nhis master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at\r\nthe expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of\r\nhis cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and\r\nsaw that they exactly fitted the tracks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Holder.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home\r\nand changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to\r\nplay then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert\r\nscandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our\r\nhands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of\r\ncourse, he denied everything. But when I gave him every\r\nparticular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a\r\nlife-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I\r\nclapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he\r\nbecame a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give\r\nhim a price for the stones he held--1000 pounds apiece. That\r\nbrought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why,\r\ndash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the\r\nthree!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had\r\nthem, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I\r\nset to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000\r\npounds apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all\r\nwas right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after\r\nwhat I may call a really hard day's work.\"\r\n\r\n\"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,\" said\r\nthe banker, rising. \"Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but\r\nyou shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your\r\nskill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I\r\nmust fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I\r\nhave done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my\r\nvery heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that we may safely say,\" returned Holmes, \"that she is\r\nwherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that\r\nwhatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than\r\nsufficient punishment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES\r\n\r\n\"To the man who loves art for its own sake,\" remarked Sherlock\r\nHolmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily\r\nTelegraph, \"it is frequently in its least important and lowliest\r\nmanifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is\r\npleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped\r\nthis truth that in these little records of our cases which you\r\nhave been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,\r\noccasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much\r\nto the many causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres and sensational trials in which I\r\nhave figured but rather to those incidents which may have been\r\ntrivial in themselves, but which have given room for those\r\nfaculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made\r\nmy special province.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said I, smiling, \"I cannot quite hold myself absolved\r\nfrom the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my\r\nrecords.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have erred, perhaps,\" he observed, taking up a glowing\r\ncinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood\r\npipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a\r\ndisputatious rather than a meditative mood--\"you have erred\r\nperhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your\r\nstatements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing\r\nupon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is\r\nreally the only notable feature about the thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,\"\r\nI remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism\r\nwhich I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my\r\nfriend's singular character.\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not selfishness or conceit,\" said he, answering, as\r\nwas his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. \"If I claim full\r\njustice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a\r\nthing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it\r\nis upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should\r\ndwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of\r\nlectures into a series of tales.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after\r\nbreakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at\r\nBaker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of\r\ndun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark,\r\nshapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit\r\nand shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for\r\nthe table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been\r\nsilent all the morning, dipping continuously into the\r\nadvertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,\r\nhaving apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very\r\nsweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\r\n\r\n\"At the same time,\" he remarked after a pause, during which he\r\nhad sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire,\r\n\"you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of\r\nthese cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself\r\nin, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense,\r\nat all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King\r\nof Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the\r\nproblem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the\r\nincident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are\r\noutside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I\r\nfear that you may have bordered on the trivial.\"\r\n\r\n\"The end may have been so,\" I answered, \"but the methods I hold\r\nto have been novel and of interest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant\r\npublic, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a\r\ncompositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of\r\nanalysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot\r\nblame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at\r\nleast criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As\r\nto my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an\r\nagency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to\r\nyoung ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched\r\nbottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my\r\nzero-point, I fancy. Read it!\" He tossed a crumpled letter across\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and\r\nran thus:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether\r\nI should or should not accept a situation which has been offered\r\nto me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I\r\ndo not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,\r\n                                               \"VIOLET HUNTER.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the young lady?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not I.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is half-past ten now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You\r\nremember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to\r\nbe a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation.\r\nIt may be so in this case, also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved,\r\nfor here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.\r\nShe was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face,\r\nfreckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a\r\nwoman who has had her own way to make in the world.\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,\" said she, as my\r\ncompanion rose to greet her, \"but I have had a very strange\r\nexperience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort\r\nfrom whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be\r\nkind enough to tell me what I should do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything\r\nthat I can to serve you.\"\r\n\r\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner\r\nand speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching\r\nfashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and\r\nhis finger-tips together, to listen to her story.\r\n\r\n\"I have been a governess for five years,\" said she, \"in the\r\nfamily of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel\r\nreceived an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his\r\nchildren over to America with him, so that I found myself without\r\na situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but\r\nwithout success. At last the little money which I had saved began\r\nto run short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.\r\n\r\n\"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End\r\ncalled Westaway's, and there I used to call about once a week in\r\norder to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me.\r\nWestaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is\r\nreally managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office,\r\nand the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom,\r\nand are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers\r\nand sees whether she has anything which would suit them.\r\n\r\n\"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office\r\nas usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A\r\nprodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy\r\nchin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at\r\nher elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very\r\nearnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a\r\njump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\r\n\r\n\"'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better.\r\nCapital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his\r\nhands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a\r\ncomfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n\"'As governess?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n\"'And what salary do you ask?'\r\n\r\n\"'I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence\r\nMunro.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his\r\nfat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling\r\npassion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with\r\nsuch attractions and accomplishments?'\r\n\r\n\"'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I.\r\n'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--'\r\n\r\n\"'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question.\r\nThe point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment\r\nof a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are\r\nnot fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a\r\nconsiderable part in the history of the country. But if you have\r\nwhy, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to\r\naccept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me,\r\nmadam, would commence at 100 pounds a year.'\r\n\r\n\"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was,\r\nsuch an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman,\r\nhowever, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face,\r\nopened a pocket-book and took out a note.\r\n\r\n\"'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant\r\nfashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid\r\nthe white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies\r\nhalf their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little\r\nexpenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so\r\nthoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the\r\nadvance was a great convenience, and yet there was something\r\nunnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know\r\na little more before I quite committed myself.\r\n\r\n\"'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles\r\non the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my\r\ndear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'\r\n\r\n\"'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would\r\nbe.'\r\n\r\n\"'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if\r\nyou could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack!\r\nsmack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He leaned back\r\nin his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.\r\n\r\n\"I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement,\r\nbut the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was\r\njoking.\r\n\r\n\"'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single\r\nchild?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he\r\ncried. 'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would\r\nsuggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided\r\nalways that they were such commands as a lady might with\r\npropriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?'\r\n\r\n\"'I should be happy to make myself useful.'\r\n\r\n\"'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you\r\nknow--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress\r\nwhich we might give you, you would not object to our little whim.\r\nHeh?'\r\n\r\n\"'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.\r\n\r\n\"'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, no.'\r\n\r\n\"'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'\r\n\r\n\"I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes,\r\nmy hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of\r\nchestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of\r\nsacrificing it in this offhand fashion.\r\n\r\n\"'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been\r\nwatching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a\r\nshadow pass over his face as I spoke.\r\n\r\n\"'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a\r\nlittle fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam,\r\nladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your\r\nhair?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a\r\npity, because in other respects you would really have done very\r\nnicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more\r\nof your young ladies.'\r\n\r\n\"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers\r\nwithout a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so\r\nmuch annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting\r\nthat she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she asked.\r\n\r\n\"'If you please, Miss Stoper.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the\r\nmost excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You\r\ncan hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such\r\nopening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong\r\nupon the table, and I was shown out by the page.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found\r\nlittle enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the\r\ntable, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very\r\nfoolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and\r\nexpected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were\r\nat least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few\r\ngovernesses in England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides,\r\nwhat use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing\r\nit short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was\r\ninclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after\r\nI was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go\r\nback to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open\r\nwhen I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it\r\nhere and I will read it to you:\r\n\r\n                       \"'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\r\n\"'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your\r\naddress, and I write from here to ask you whether you have\r\nreconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you\r\nshould come, for she has been much attracted by my description of\r\nyou. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120 pounds a\r\nyear, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which\r\nour fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My\r\nwife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would\r\nlike you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need\r\nnot, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one\r\nbelonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which\r\nwould, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting\r\nhere or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that\r\nneed cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no\r\ndoubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty\r\nduring our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain\r\nfirm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary\r\nmay recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child\r\nis concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall\r\nmeet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train.\r\nYours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'\r\n\r\n\"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and\r\nmy mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however,\r\nthat before taking the final step I should like to submit the\r\nwhole matter to your consideration.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the\r\nquestion,\" said Holmes, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"But you would not advise me to refuse?\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to\r\nsee a sister of mine apply for.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself\r\nformed some opinion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr.\r\nRucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not\r\npossible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the\r\nmatter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that\r\nhe humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an\r\noutbreak?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is\r\nthe most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a\r\nnice household for a young lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what\r\nmakes me uneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when\r\nthey could have their pick for 40 pounds? There must be some\r\nstrong reason behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would\r\nunderstand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so\r\nmuch stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that\r\nyour little problem promises to be the most interesting which has\r\ncome my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel\r\nabout some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt\r\nor in danger--\"\r\n\r\n\"Danger! What danger do you foresee?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head gravely. \"It would cease to be a danger if\r\nwe could define it,\" said he. \"But at any time, day or night, a\r\ntelegram would bring me down to your help.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is enough.\" She rose briskly from her chair with the\r\nanxiety all swept from her face. \"I shall go down to Hampshire\r\nquite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once,\r\nsacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester\r\nto-morrow.\" With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both\r\ngood-night and bustled off upon her way.\r\n\r\n\"At least,\" said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending\r\nthe stairs, \"she seems to be a young lady who is very well able\r\nto take care of herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And she would need to be,\" said Holmes gravely. \"I am much\r\nmistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled.\r\nA fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts\r\nturning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of\r\nhuman experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual\r\nsalary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to\r\nsomething abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether\r\nthe man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond\r\nmy powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat\r\nfrequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an\r\nabstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his\r\nhand when I mentioned it. \"Data! data! data!\" he cried\r\nimpatiently. \"I can't make bricks without clay.\" And yet he would\r\nalways wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever\r\nhave accepted such a situation.\r\n\r\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night\r\njust as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down\r\nto one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently\r\nindulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a\r\ntest-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came\r\ndown to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope,\r\nand then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\r\n\r\n\"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,\" said he, and turned back\r\nto his chemical studies.\r\n\r\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\r\n\r\n\"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday\r\nto-morrow,\" it said. \"Do come! I am at my wit's end.  HUNTER.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you come with me?\" asked Holmes, glancing up.\r\n\r\n\"I should wish to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just look it up, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a train at half-past nine,\" said I, glancing over my\r\nBradshaw. \"It is due at Winchester at 11:30.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my\r\nanalysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nBy eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the\r\nold English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers\r\nall the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he\r\nthrew them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal\r\nspring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white\r\nclouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining\r\nvery brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air,\r\nwhich set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside,\r\naway to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and\r\ngrey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light\r\ngreen of the new foliage.\r\n\r\n\"Are they not fresh and beautiful?\" I cried with all the\r\nenthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\r\n\r\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Watson,\" said he, \"that it is one of the curses of\r\na mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with\r\nreference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered\r\nhouses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them,\r\nand the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their\r\nisolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" I cried. \"Who would associate crime with these\r\ndear old homesteads?\"\r\n\r\n\"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief,\r\nWatson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest\r\nalleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin\r\nthan does the smiling and beautiful countryside.\"\r\n\r\n\"You horrify me!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion\r\ncan do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no\r\nlane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of\r\na drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among\r\nthe neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever\r\nso close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is\r\nbut a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these\r\nlonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part\r\nwith poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the\r\ndeeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on,\r\nyear in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this\r\nlady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I\r\nshould never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of\r\ncountry which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is\r\nnot personally threatened.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. She has her freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"What CAN be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would\r\ncover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is\r\ncorrect can only be determined by the fresh information which we\r\nshall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of\r\nthe cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has\r\nto tell.\"\r\n\r\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no\r\ndistance from the station, and there we found the young lady\r\nwaiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch\r\nawaited us upon the table.\r\n\r\n\"I am so delighted that you have come,\" she said earnestly. \"It\r\nis so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I\r\nshould do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray tell us what has happened to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.\r\nRucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into\r\ntown this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us have everything in its due order.\" Holmes thrust his long\r\nthin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole,\r\nwith no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is\r\nonly fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and\r\nI am not easy in my mind about them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can you not understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just\r\nas it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and\r\ndrove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he\r\nsaid, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself,\r\nfor it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all\r\nstained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds\r\nround it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which\r\nslopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about\r\na hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs\r\nto the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord\r\nSoutherton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in\r\nfront of the hall door has given its name to the place.\r\n\r\n\"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever,\r\nand was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.\r\nThere was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to\r\nus to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is\r\nnot mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much\r\nyounger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think,\r\nwhile he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their\r\nconversation I have gathered that they have been married about\r\nseven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by\r\nthe first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr.\r\nRucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them\r\nwas that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As\r\nthe daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite\r\nimagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her\r\nfather's young wife.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as\r\nin feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.\r\nShe was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately\r\ndevoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey\r\neyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every\r\nlittle want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her\r\nalso in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they\r\nseemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow,\r\nthis woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the\r\nsaddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her\r\nin tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of\r\nher child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so\r\nutterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small\r\nfor his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.\r\nHis whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between\r\nsavage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving\r\npain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea\r\nof amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning\r\nthe capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would\r\nrather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he\r\nhas little to do with my story.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad of all details,\" remarked my friend, \"whether they\r\nseem to you to be relevant or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one\r\nunpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was\r\nthe appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a\r\nman and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough,\r\nuncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual\r\nsmell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been\r\nquite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it.\r\nHis wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as\r\nsilent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most\r\nunpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the\r\nnursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one\r\ncorner of the building.\r\n\r\n\"For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was\r\nvery quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after\r\nbreakfast and whispered something to her husband.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to\r\nyou, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut\r\nyour hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest\r\niota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue\r\ndress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in\r\nyour room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should\r\nboth be extremely obliged.'\r\n\r\n\"The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade\r\nof blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it\r\nbore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not\r\nhave been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which\r\nseemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for\r\nme in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching\r\nalong the entire front of the house, with three long windows\r\nreaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the\r\ncentral window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was\r\nasked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the\r\nother side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest\r\nstories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how\r\ncomical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs.\r\nRucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so\r\nmuch as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad,\r\nanxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle\r\nsuddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the\r\nday, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in\r\nthe nursery.\r\n\r\n\"Two days later this same performance was gone through under\r\nexactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I\r\nsat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny\r\nstories of which my employer had an immense r\u00e9pertoire, and which\r\nhe told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and\r\nmoving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not\r\nfall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for\r\nabout ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then\r\nsuddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and\r\nto change my dress.\r\n\r\n\"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to\r\nwhat the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly\r\nbe. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face\r\naway from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire\r\nto see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be\r\nimpossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been\r\nbroken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of\r\nthe glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst\r\nof my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able\r\nwith a little management to see all that there was behind me. I\r\nconfess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that\r\nwas my first impression. At the second glance, however, I\r\nperceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road,\r\na small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in\r\nmy direction. The road is an important highway, and there are\r\nusually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the\r\nrailings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I\r\nlowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her\r\neyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing,\r\nbut I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my\r\nhand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\r\n\r\n\"'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the\r\nroad there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'\r\n\r\n\"'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.\r\n\r\n\"'No, I know no one in these parts.'\r\n\r\n\"'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to\r\nhim to go away.'\r\n\r\n\"'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'\r\n\r\n\"'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn\r\nround and wave him away like that.'\r\n\r\n\"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew\r\ndown the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have\r\nnot sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor\r\nseen the man in the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray continue,\" said Holmes. \"Your narrative promises to be a\r\nmost interesting one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may\r\nprove to be little relation between the different incidents of\r\nwhich I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper\r\nBeeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands\r\nnear the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp\r\nrattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\"'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two\r\nplanks. 'Is he not a beauty?'\r\n\r\n\"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a\r\nvague figure huddled up in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start\r\nwhich I had given. 'It's only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine,\r\nbut really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do\r\nanything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then,\r\nso that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose\r\nevery night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs\r\nupon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your\r\nfoot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life\r\nis worth.'\r\n\r\n\"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to\r\nlook out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning.\r\nIt was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the\r\nhouse was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was\r\nstanding, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was\r\naware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper\r\nbeeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It\r\nwas a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging\r\njowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly\r\nacross the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.\r\nThat dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not\r\nthink that any burglar could have done.\r\n\r\n\"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as\r\nyou know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a\r\ngreat coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the\r\nchild was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the\r\nfurniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things.\r\nThere was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones\r\nempty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two\r\nwith my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was\r\nnaturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It\r\nstruck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight,\r\nso I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very\r\nfirst key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There\r\nwas only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never\r\nguess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\r\n\r\n\"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint,\r\nand the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing\r\nobtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in\r\nthe drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the\r\ncontents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two\r\ntresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was\r\nit not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at\r\nall of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer,\r\nand I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that\r\nI had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had\r\nlocked.\r\n\r\n\"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes,\r\nand I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.\r\nThere was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited\r\nat all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of\r\nthe Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked.\r\nOne day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle\r\ncoming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on\r\nhis face which made him a very different person to the round,\r\njovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his\r\nbrow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his\r\ntemples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me\r\nwithout a word or a look.\r\n\r\n\"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the\r\ngrounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I\r\ncould see the windows of this part of the house. There were four\r\nof them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the\r\nfourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I\r\nstrolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle\r\ncame out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you\r\nwithout a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with\r\nbusiness matters.'\r\n\r\n\"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I,\r\n'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one\r\nof them has the shutters up.'\r\n\r\n\"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled\r\nat my remark.\r\n\r\n\"'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my\r\ndark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we\r\nhave come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever\r\nbelieved it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest\r\nin his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and\r\nannoyance, but no jest.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there\r\nwas something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know,\r\nI was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity,\r\nthough I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a\r\nfeeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this\r\nplace. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's\r\ninstinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,\r\nand I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the\r\nforbidden door.\r\n\r\n\"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,\r\nbesides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to\r\ndo in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large\r\nblack linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been\r\ndrinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when\r\nI came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at\r\nall that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both\r\ndownstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an\r\nadmirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock,\r\nopened the door, and slipped through.\r\n\r\n\"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and\r\nuncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end.\r\nRound this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third\r\nof which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and\r\ncheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so\r\nthick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through\r\nthem. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it\r\nhad been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked\r\nat one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with\r\nstout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was\r\nnot there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the\r\nshuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from\r\nbeneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was\r\na skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the\r\npassage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it\r\nmight veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room\r\nand saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little\r\nslit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad,\r\nunreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My\r\noverstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran\r\nas though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the\r\nskirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door,\r\nand straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\"'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it\r\nmust be when I saw the door open.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.\r\n\r\n\"'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how\r\ncaressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened\r\nyou, my dear young lady?'\r\n\r\n\"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I\r\nwas keenly on my guard against him.\r\n\r\n\"'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered.\r\n'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was\r\nfrightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in\r\nthere!'\r\n\r\n\"'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, what did you think?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Why do you think that I lock this door?'\r\n\r\n\"'I am sure that I do not know.'\r\n\r\n\"'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you\r\nsee?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\r\n\r\n\"'I am sure if I had known--'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over\r\nthat threshold again'--here in an instant the smile hardened into\r\na grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a\r\ndemon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'\r\n\r\n\"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that\r\nI must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing\r\nuntil I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I\r\nthought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without\r\nsome advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the\r\nwoman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible\r\nto me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of\r\ncourse I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was\r\nalmost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would\r\nsend you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the\r\noffice, which is about half a mile from the house, and then\r\nreturned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my\r\nmind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I\r\nremembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of\r\ninsensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one\r\nin the household who had any influence with the savage creature,\r\nor who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and\r\nlay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you.\r\nI had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this\r\nmorning, but I must be back before three o'clock, for Mr. and\r\nMrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the\r\nevening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you\r\nall my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you\r\ncould tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story.\r\nMy friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in\r\nhis pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\"Is Toller still drunk?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do\r\nnothing with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the wine-cellar.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very\r\nbrave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could\r\nperform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not\r\nthink you a quite exceptional woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try. What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend\r\nand I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will,\r\nwe hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might\r\ngive the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some\r\nerrand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate\r\nmatters immensely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of\r\ncourse there is only one feasible explanation. You have been\r\nbrought there to personate someone, and the real person is\r\nimprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this\r\nprisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice\r\nRucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to\r\nAmerica. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height,\r\nfigure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very\r\npossibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of\r\ncourse, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you\r\ncame upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some\r\nfriend of hers--possibly her fianc\u00e9--and no doubt, as you wore\r\nthe girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your\r\nlaughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture,\r\nthat Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer\r\ndesired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent\r\nhim from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly\r\nclear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of\r\nthe child.\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth has that to do with it?\" I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining\r\nlight as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the\r\nparents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have\r\nfrequently gained my first real insight into the character of\r\nparents by studying their children. This child's disposition is\r\nabnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he\r\nderives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or\r\nfrom his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\" cried our client. \"A\r\nthousand things come back to me which make me certain that you\r\nhave hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to\r\nthis poor creature.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning\r\nman. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall\r\nbe with you, and it will not be long before we solve the\r\nmystery.\"\r\n\r\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we\r\nreached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside\r\npublic-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining\r\nlike burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were\r\nsufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been\r\nstanding smiling on the door-step.\r\n\r\n\"Have you managed it?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. \"That is\r\nMrs. Toller in the cellar,\" said she. \"Her husband lies snoring\r\non the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates\r\nof Mr. Rucastle's.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have done well indeed!\" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. \"Now\r\nlead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a\r\npassage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss\r\nHunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the\r\ntransverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but\r\nwithout success. No sound came from within, and at the silence\r\nHolmes' face clouded over.\r\n\r\n\"I trust that we are not too late,\" said he. \"I think, Miss\r\nHunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put\r\nyour shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our\r\nway in.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united\r\nstrength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There\r\nwas no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a\r\nbasketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\"There has been some villainy here,\" said Holmes; \"this beauty\r\nhas guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.\" He\r\nswung himself up onto the roof. \"Ah, yes,\" he cried, \"here's the\r\nend of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is impossible,\" said Miss Hunter; \"the ladder was not\r\nthere when the Rucastles went away.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and\r\ndangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were\r\nhe whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it\r\nwould be as well for you to have your pistol ready.\"\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at\r\nthe door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy\r\nstick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the\r\nwall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and\r\nconfronted him.\r\n\r\n\"You villain!\" said he, \"where's your daughter?\"\r\n\r\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open\r\nskylight.\r\n\r\n\"It is for me to ask you that,\" he shrieked, \"you thieves! Spies\r\nand thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'll\r\nserve you!\" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he\r\ncould go.\r\n\r\n\"He's gone for the dog!\" cried Miss Hunter.\r\n\r\n\"I have my revolver,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Better close the front door,\" cried Holmes, and we all rushed\r\ndown the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we\r\nheard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a\r\nhorrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An\r\nelderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out\r\nat a side door.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" he cried. \"Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been\r\nfed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!\"\r\n\r\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with\r\nToller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its\r\nblack muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and\r\nscreamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and\r\nit fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great\r\ncreases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and\r\ncarried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid\r\nhim upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered\r\nToller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to\r\nrelieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door\r\nopened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Toller!\" cried Miss Hunter.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he\r\nwent up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know\r\nwhat you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains\r\nwere wasted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. \"It is clear that Mrs.\r\nToller knows more about this matter than anyone else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several\r\npoints on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will soon make it clear to you,\" said she; \"and I'd have done\r\nso before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. If there's\r\npolice-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the\r\none that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time\r\nthat her father married again. She was slighted like and had no\r\nsay in anything, but it never really became bad for her until\r\nafter she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could\r\nlearn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so\r\nquiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them\r\nbut just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was\r\nsafe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming\r\nforward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then\r\nher father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to\r\nsign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use\r\nher money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until\r\nshe got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. Then\r\nshe got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her\r\nbeautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her\r\nyoung man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Holmes, \"I think that what you have been good enough\r\nto tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce\r\nall that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this\r\nsystem of imprisonment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of\r\nthe disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was it, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should\r\nbe, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain\r\narguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your\r\ninterests were the same as his.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,\" said\r\nMrs. Toller serenely.\r\n\r\n\"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no\r\nwant of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment\r\nwhen your master had gone out.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have it, sir, just as it happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,\" said Holmes, \"for\r\nyou have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And\r\nhere comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think,\r\nWatson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester,\r\nas it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a\r\nquestionable one.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the\r\ncopper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but\r\nwas always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of\r\nhis devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who\r\nprobably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it\r\ndifficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were\r\nmarried, by special license, in Southampton the day after their\r\nflight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in\r\nthe island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend\r\nHolmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further\r\ninterest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one\r\nof his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at\r\nWalsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by \r\nArthur Conan Doyle\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1661-8.txt or 1661-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/6/6/1661/\r\n\r\nProduced by an anonymous Project Gutenberg volunteer and Jose Menendez\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n", "author": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle", "tags": ["1001", "1001 books", "19th century", "Arthur Conan Doyle", "British", "British literature", "classic", "classics", "collection", "crime", "crime fiction", "detective", "detective fiction", "ebook", "England", "English", "English literature", "fiction", "Holmes", "Kindle", "literature", "London", "mystery", "novel", "read", "Sherlock Holmes", "short stories", "unread", "Victorian"], "title": "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"}, {"text": "\ufeffProject Gutenberg's The Yellow Wallpaper, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman\r\n\r\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\r\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

And why have stood so long\r\nuntenanted?\r\n\r\nJohn laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.\r\n\r\nJohn is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an\r\nintense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of\r\nthings not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.\r\n\r\nJohn is a physician, and PERHAPS--(I would not say it to a living\r\nsoul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my\r\nmind)--PERHAPS that is one reason I do not get well faster.\r\n\r\nYou see he does not believe I am sick!\r\n\r\nAnd what can one do?\r\n\r\nIf a physician of high standing, and one's own husband, assures friends\r\nand relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but\r\ntemporary nervous depression--a slight hysterical tendency--what is one\r\nto do?\r\n\r\nMy brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says\r\nthe same thing.\r\n\r\nSo I take phosphates or phosphites--whichever it is, and tonics, and\r\njourneys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to \"work\"\r\nuntil I am well again.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I disagree with their ideas.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change,\r\nwould do me good.\r\n\r\nBut what is one to do?\r\n\r\nI did write for a while in spite of them; but it DOES exhaust me a good\r\ndeal--having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.\r\n\r\nI sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more\r\nsociety and stimulus--but John says the very worst thing I can do is to\r\nthink about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.\r\n\r\nSo I will let it alone and talk about the house.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the\r\nroad, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English\r\nplaces that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates\r\nthat lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThere is a DELICIOUS garden! I never saw such a garden--large and shady,\r\nfull of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors\r\nwith seats under them.\r\n\r\nThere were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.\r\n\r\nThere was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and\r\ncoheirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.\r\n\r\nThat spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid, but I don't care--there is\r\nsomething strange about the house--I can feel it.\r\n\r\nI even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt\r\nwas a DRAUGHT, and shut the window.\r\n\r\nI get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I'm sure I never used to\r\nbe so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.\r\n\r\nBut John says if I feel so, I shall neglect proper self-control; so I\r\ntake pains to control myself--before him, at least, and that makes me\r\nvery tired.\r\n\r\nI don't like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the\r\npiazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned\r\nchintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.\r\n\r\nHe said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near\r\nroom for him if he took another.\r\n\r\nHe is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nI have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all\r\ncare from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.\r\n\r\nHe said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect\r\nrest and all the air I could get. \"Your exercise depends on your\r\nstrength, my dear,\" said he, \"and your food somewhat on your appetite;\r\nbut air you can absorb all the time.\" So we took the nursery at the top\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\nIt is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look\r\nall ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then\r\nplayroom and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred for\r\nlittle children, and there are rings and things in the walls.\r\n\r\nThe paint and paper look as if a boys' school had used it. It is\r\nstripped off--the paper--in great patches all around the head of my bed,\r\nabout as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of\r\nthe room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.\r\n\r\nOne of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic\r\nsin.\r\n\r\nIt is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough\r\nto constantly irritate and provoke study, and when you follow the\r\nlame uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit\r\nsuicide--plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard\r\nof contradictions.\r\n\r\nThe color is repellent, almost revolting; a smouldering unclean yellow,\r\nstrangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.\r\n\r\nIt is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the children hated it! I should hate it myself if I had to\r\nlive in this room long.\r\n\r\nThere comes John, and I must put this away,--he hates to have me write a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been here two weeks, and I haven't felt like writing before,\r\nsince that first day.\r\n\r\nI am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and\r\nthere is nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nJohn is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.\r\n\r\nI am glad my case is not serious!\r\n\r\nBut these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.\r\n\r\nJohn does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no REASON\r\nto suffer, and that satisfies him.\r\n\r\nOf course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my\r\nduty in any way!\r\n\r\nI meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and\r\nhere I am a comparative burden already!\r\n\r\nNobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am\r\nable,--to dress and entertain, and order things.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby!\r\n\r\nAnd yet I CANNOT be with him, it makes me so nervous.\r\n\r\nI suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about\r\nthis wall-paper!\r\n\r\nAt first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I\r\nwas letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a\r\nnervous patient than to give way to such fancies.\r\n\r\nHe said that after the wall-paper was changed it would be the heavy\r\nbedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head of\r\nthe stairs, and so on.\r\n\r\n\"You know the place is doing you good,\" he said, \"and really, dear, I\r\ndon't care to renovate the house just for a three months' rental.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then do let us go downstairs,\" I said, \"there are such pretty rooms\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nThen he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose,\r\nand said he would go down to the cellar, if I wished, and have it\r\nwhitewashed into the bargain.\r\n\r\nBut he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.\r\n\r\nIt is an airy and comfortable room as any one need wish, and, of course,\r\nI would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a whim.\r\n\r\nI'm really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nOut of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deepshaded\r\narbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.\r\n\r\nOut of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf\r\nbelonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs\r\ndown there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these\r\nnumerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to\r\nfancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of\r\nstory-making, a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner\r\nof excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to\r\ncheck the tendency. So I try.\r\n\r\nI think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it\r\nwould relieve the press of ideas and rest me.\r\n\r\nBut I find I get pretty tired when I try.\r\n\r\nIt is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about\r\nmy work. When I get really well, John says we will ask Cousin Henry and\r\nJulia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put fireworks\r\nin my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people about now.\r\n\r\nI wish I could get well faster.\r\n\r\nBut I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it KNEW\r\nwhat a vicious influence it had!\r\n\r\nThere is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and\r\ntwo bulbous eyes stare at you upside down.\r\n\r\nI get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the\r\neverlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd,\r\nunblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths\r\ndidn't match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little\r\nhigher than the other.\r\n\r\nI never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all\r\nknow how much expression they have! I used to lie awake as a child and\r\nget more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain furniture\r\nthan most children could find in a toy store.\r\n\r\nI remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big, old bureau used to\r\nhave, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend.\r\n\r\nI used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce I could\r\nalways hop into that chair and be safe.\r\n\r\nThe furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for\r\nwe had to bring it all from downstairs. I suppose when this was used\r\nas a playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I\r\nnever saw such ravages as the children have made here.\r\n\r\nThe wall-paper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh\r\ncloser than a brother--they must have had perseverance as well as\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\nThen the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster\r\nitself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed which is all\r\nwe found in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.\r\n\r\nBut I don't mind it a bit--only the paper.\r\n\r\nThere comes John's sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful of\r\nme! I must not let her find me writing.\r\n\r\nShe is a perfect and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better\r\nprofession. I verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me\r\nsick!\r\n\r\nBut I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nThere is one that commands the road, a lovely shaded winding road, and\r\none that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too, full of\r\ngreat elms and velvet meadows.\r\n\r\nThis wall-paper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a\r\nparticularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights,\r\nand not clearly then.\r\n\r\nBut in the places where it isn't faded and where the sun is just so--I\r\ncan see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to\r\nskulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.\r\n\r\nThere's sister on the stairs!\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, the Fourth of July is over! The people are gone and I am tired\r\nout. John thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we\r\njust had mother and Nellie and the children down for a week.\r\n\r\nOf course I didn't do a thing. Jennie sees to everything now.\r\n\r\nBut it tired me all the same.\r\n\r\nJohn says if I don't pick up faster he shall send me to Weir Mitchell in\r\nthe fall.\r\n\r\nBut I don't want to go there at all. I had a friend who was in his hands\r\nonce, and she says he is just like John and my brother, only more so!\r\n\r\nBesides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.\r\n\r\nI don't feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for anything,\r\nand I'm getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.\r\n\r\nI cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.\r\n\r\nOf course I don't when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAnd I am alone a good deal just now. John is kept in town very often by\r\nserious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.\r\n\r\nSo I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the\r\nporch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.\r\n\r\nI'm getting really fond of the room in spite of the wall-paper. Perhaps\r\nBECAUSE of the wall-paper.\r\n\r\nIt dwells in my mind so!\r\n\r\nI lie here on this great immovable bed--it is nailed down, I\r\nbelieve--and follow that pattern about by the hour. It is as good as\r\ngymnastics, I assure you. I start, we'll say, at the bottom, down in the\r\ncorner over there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the\r\nthousandth time that I WILL follow that pointless pattern to some sort\r\nof a conclusion.\r\n\r\nI know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was\r\nnot arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition, or\r\nsymmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.\r\n\r\nIt is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\nLooked at in one way each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and\r\nflourishes--a kind of \"debased Romanesque\" with delirium tremens--go\r\nwaddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling\r\noutlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of\r\nwallowing seaweeds in full chase.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I\r\nexhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThey have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds\r\nwonderfully to the confusion.\r\n\r\nThere is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when\r\nthe crosslights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can\r\nalmost fancy radiation after all,--the interminable grotesques seem to\r\nform around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal\r\ndistraction.\r\n\r\nIt makes me tired to follow it. I will take a nap I guess.\r\n\r\nI don't know why I should write this.\r\n\r\nI don't want to.\r\n\r\nI don't feel able.\r\n\r\nAnd I know John would think it absurd. But I MUST say what I feel and\r\nthink in some way--it is such a relief!\r\n\r\nBut the effort is getting to be greater than the relief.\r\n\r\nHalf the time now I am awfully lazy, and lie down ever so much.\r\n\r\nJohn says I musn't lose my strength, and has me take cod liver oil and\r\nlots of tonics and things, to say nothing of ale and wine and rare meat.\r\n\r\nDear John! He loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick. I tried\r\nto have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell\r\nhim how I wish he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and\r\nJulia.\r\n\r\nBut he said I wasn't able to go, nor able to stand it after I got there;\r\nand I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was crying\r\nbefore I had finished.\r\n\r\nIt is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this\r\nnervous weakness I suppose.\r\n\r\nAnd dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs\r\nand laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nHe said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I\r\nmust take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.\r\n\r\nHe says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my will\r\nand self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me.\r\n\r\nThere's one comfort, the baby is well and happy, and does not have to\r\noccupy this nursery with the horrid wall-paper.\r\n\r\nIf we had not used it, that blessed child would have! What a fortunate\r\nescape! Why, I wouldn't have a child of mine, an impressionable little\r\nthing, live in such a room for worlds.\r\n\r\nI never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here\r\nafter all, I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.\r\n\r\nOf course I never mention it to them any more--I am too wise,--but I\r\nkeep watch of it all the same.\r\n\r\nThere are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.\r\n\r\nBehind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.\r\n\r\nIt is always the same shape, only very numerous.\r\n\r\nAnd it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that\r\npattern. I don't like it a bit. I wonder--I begin to think--I wish John\r\nwould take me away from here!\r\n\r\nIt is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise,\r\nand because he loves me so.\r\n\r\nBut I tried it last night.\r\n\r\nIt was moonlight. The moon shines in all around just as the sun does.\r\n\r\nI hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by\r\none window or another.\r\n\r\nJohn was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched\r\nthe moonlight on that undulating wall-paper till I felt creepy.\r\n\r\nThe faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she\r\nwanted to get out.\r\n\r\nI got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper DID move, and when\r\nI came back John was awake.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, little girl?\" he said. \"Don't go walking about like\r\nthat--you'll get cold.\"\r\n\r\nI though it was a good time to talk, so I told him that I really was not\r\ngaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.\r\n\r\n\"Why darling!\" said he, \"our lease will be up in three weeks, and I\r\ncan't see how to leave before.\r\n\r\n\"The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town just\r\nnow. Of course if you were in any danger, I could and would, but you\r\nreally are better, dear, whether you can see it or not. I am a doctor,\r\ndear, and I know. You are gaining flesh and color, your appetite is\r\nbetter, I feel really much easier about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't weigh a bit more,\" said I, \"nor as much; and my appetite may be\r\nbetter in the evening when you are here, but it is worse in the morning\r\nwhen you are away!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless her little heart!\" said he with a big hug, \"she shall be as sick\r\nas she pleases! But now let's improve the shining hours by going to\r\nsleep, and talk about it in the morning!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you won't go away?\" I asked gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"Why, how can I, dear? It is only three weeks more and then we will\r\ntake a nice little trip of a few days while Jennie is getting the house\r\nready. Really dear you are better!\"\r\n\r\n\"Better in body perhaps--\" I began, and stopped short, for he sat up\r\nstraight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I\r\ncould not say another word.\r\n\r\n\"My darling,\" said he, \"I beg of you, for my sake and for our child's\r\nsake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant\r\nlet that idea enter your mind! There is nothing so dangerous, so\r\nfascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish\r\nfancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?\"\r\n\r\nSo of course I said no more on that score, and we went to sleep before\r\nlong. He thought I was asleep first, but I wasn't, and lay there for\r\nhours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern\r\nreally did move together or separately.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a\r\ndefiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind.\r\n\r\nThe color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating\r\nenough, but the pattern is torturing.\r\n\r\nYou think you have mastered it, but just as you get well underway in\r\nfollowing, it turns a back-somersault and there you are. It slaps you\r\nin the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you. It is like a bad\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nThe outside pattern is a florid arabesque, reminding one of a fungus.\r\nIf you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable string of\r\ntoadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions--why, that is\r\nsomething like it.\r\n\r\nThat is, sometimes!\r\n\r\nThere is one marked peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems\r\nto notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun shoots in through the east window--I always watch for that\r\nfirst long, straight ray--it changes so quickly that I never can quite\r\nbelieve it.\r\n\r\nThat is why I watch it always.\r\n\r\nBy moonlight--the moon shines in all night when there is a moon--I\r\nwouldn't know it was the same paper.\r\n\r\nAt night in any kind of light, in twilight, candle light, lamplight, and\r\nworst of all by moonlight, it becomes bars! The outside pattern I mean,\r\nand the woman behind it is as plain as can be.\r\n\r\nI didn't realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind,\r\nthat dim sub-pattern, but now I am quite sure it is a woman.\r\n\r\nBy daylight she is subdued, quiet. I fancy it is the pattern that keeps\r\nher so still. It is so puzzling. It keeps me quiet by the hour.\r\n\r\nI lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep\r\nall I can.\r\n\r\nIndeed he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after each\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nIt is a very bad habit I am convinced, for you see I don't sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd that cultivates deceit, for I don't tell them I'm awake--O no!\r\n\r\nThe fact is I am getting a little afraid of John.\r\n\r\nHe seems very queer sometimes, and even Jennie has an inexplicable look.\r\n\r\nIt strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis,--that\r\nperhaps it is the paper!\r\n\r\nI have watched John when he did not know I was looking, and come into\r\nthe room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I've caught him\r\nseveral times LOOKING AT THE PAPER! And Jennie too. I caught Jennie with\r\nher hand on it once.\r\n\r\nShe didn't know I was in the room, and when I asked her in a quiet, a\r\nvery quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she\r\nwas doing with the paper--she turned around as if she had been caught\r\nstealing, and looked quite angry--asked me why I should frighten her so!\r\n\r\nThen she said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she had\r\nfound yellow smooches on all my clothes and John's, and she wished we\r\nwould be more careful!\r\n\r\nDid not that sound innocent? But I know she was studying that pattern,\r\nand I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!\r\n\r\n\r\nLife is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have\r\nsomething more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat\r\nbetter, and am more quiet than I was.\r\n\r\nJohn is so pleased to see me improve! He laughed a little the other day,\r\nand said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wall-paper.\r\n\r\nI turned it off with a laugh. I had no intention of telling him it was\r\nBECAUSE of the wall-paper--he would make fun of me. He might even want\r\nto take me away.\r\n\r\nI don't want to leave now until I have found it out. There is a week\r\nmore, and I think that will be enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm feeling ever so much better! I don't sleep much at night, for it\r\nis so interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the\r\ndaytime.\r\n\r\nIn the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.\r\n\r\nThere are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow\r\nall over it. I cannot keep count of them, though I have tried\r\nconscientiously.\r\n\r\nIt is the strangest yellow, that wall-paper! It makes me think of all\r\nthe yellow things I ever saw--not beautiful ones like buttercups, but\r\nold foul, bad yellow things.\r\n\r\nBut there is something else about that paper--the smell! I noticed it\r\nthe moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was\r\nnot bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the windows\r\nare open or not, the smell is here.\r\n\r\nIt creeps all over the house.\r\n\r\nI find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding in\r\nthe hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.\r\n\r\nIt gets into my hair.\r\n\r\nEven when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise\r\nit--there is that smell!\r\n\r\nSuch a peculiar odor, too! I have spent hours in trying to analyze it,\r\nto find what it smelled like.\r\n\r\nIt is not bad--at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most\r\nenduring odor I ever met.\r\n\r\nIn this damp weather it is awful, I wake up in the night and find it\r\nhanging over me.\r\n\r\nIt used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the\r\nhouse--to reach the smell.\r\n\r\nBut now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like\r\nis the COLOR of the paper! A yellow smell.\r\n\r\nThere is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard.\r\nA streak that runs round the room. It goes behind every piece of\r\nfurniture, except the bed, a long, straight, even SMOOCH, as if it had\r\nbeen rubbed over and over.\r\n\r\nI wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for. Round\r\nand round and round--round and round and round--it makes me dizzy!\r\n\r\n\r\nI really have discovered something at last.\r\n\r\nThrough watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally\r\nfound out.\r\n\r\nThe front pattern DOES move--and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it!\r\n\r\nSometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes\r\nonly one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThen in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady\r\nspots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.\r\n\r\nAnd she is all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb\r\nthrough that pattern--it strangles so; I think that is why it has so\r\nmany heads.\r\n\r\nThey get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them\r\nupside down, and makes their eyes white!\r\n\r\nIf those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that woman gets out in the daytime!\r\n\r\nAnd I'll tell you why--privately--I've seen her!\r\n\r\nI can see her out of every one of my windows!\r\n\r\nIt is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most women\r\ndo not creep by daylight.\r\n\r\nI see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a\r\ncarriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines.\r\n\r\nI don't blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating to be caught\r\ncreeping by daylight!\r\n\r\nI always lock the door when I creep by daylight. I can't do it at night,\r\nfor I know John would suspect something at once.\r\n\r\nAnd John is so queer now, that I don't want to irritate him. I wish he\r\nwould take another room! Besides, I don't want anybody to get that woman\r\nout at night but myself.\r\n\r\nI often wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once.\r\n\r\nBut, turn as fast as I can, I can only see out of one at one time.\r\n\r\nAnd though I always see her, she MAY be able to creep faster than I can\r\nturn!\r\n\r\nI have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as\r\nfast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.\r\n\r\nIf only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean\r\nto try it, little by little.\r\n\r\nI have found out another funny thing, but I shan't tell it this time! It\r\ndoes not do to trust people too much.\r\n\r\nThere are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John\r\nis beginning to notice. I don't like the look in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me. She\r\nhad a very good report to give.\r\n\r\nShe said I slept a good deal in the daytime.\r\n\r\nJohn knows I don't sleep very well at night, for all I'm so quiet!\r\n\r\nHe asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very loving\r\nand kind.\r\n\r\nAs if I couldn't see through him!\r\n\r\nStill, I don't wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIt only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly\r\naffected by it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town\r\nover night, and won't be out until this evening.\r\n\r\nJennie wanted to sleep with me--the sly thing! but I told her I should\r\nundoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.\r\n\r\nThat was clever, for really I wasn't alone a bit! As soon as it was\r\nmoonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I\r\ngot up and ran to help her.\r\n\r\nI pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we\r\nhad peeled off yards of that paper.\r\n\r\nA strip about as high as my head and half around the room.\r\n\r\nAnd then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me,\r\nI declared I would finish it to-day!\r\n\r\nWe go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again to\r\nleave things as they were before.\r\n\r\nJennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her merrily that I\r\ndid it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.\r\n\r\nShe laughed and said she wouldn't mind doing it herself, but I must not\r\nget tired.\r\n\r\nHow she betrayed herself that time!\r\n\r\nBut I am here, and no person touches this paper but me--not ALIVE!\r\n\r\nShe tried to get me out of the room--it was too patent! But I said it\r\nwas so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down\r\nagain and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner--I would\r\ncall when I woke.\r\n\r\nSo now she is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone,\r\nand there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down, with the\r\ncanvas mattress we found on it.\r\n\r\nWe shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.\r\n\r\nHow those children did tear about here!\r\n\r\nThis bedstead is fairly gnawed!\r\n\r\nBut I must get to work.\r\n\r\nI have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.\r\n\r\nI don't want to go out, and I don't want to have anybody come in, till\r\nJohn comes.\r\n\r\nI want to astonish him.\r\n\r\nI've got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman\r\ndoes get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!\r\n\r\nBut I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!\r\n\r\nThis bed will NOT move!\r\n\r\nI tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I\r\nbit off a little piece at one corner--but it hurt my teeth.\r\n\r\nThen I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor.\r\nIt sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled\r\nheads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with\r\nderision!\r\n\r\nI am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the\r\nwindow would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to\r\ntry.\r\n\r\nBesides I wouldn't do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step\r\nlike that is improper and might be misconstrued.\r\n\r\nI don't like to LOOK out of the windows even--there are so many of those\r\ncreeping women, and they creep so fast.\r\n\r\nI wonder if they all come out of that wall-paper as I did?\r\n\r\nBut I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope--you don't get ME\r\nout in the road there!\r\n\r\nI suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes\r\nnight, and that is hard!\r\n\r\nIt is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I\r\nplease!\r\n\r\nI don't want to go outside. I won't, even if Jennie asks me to.\r\n\r\nFor outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green\r\ninstead of yellow.\r\n\r\nBut here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in\r\nthat long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.\r\n\r\nWhy there's John at the door!\r\n\r\nIt is no use, young man, you can't open it!\r\n\r\nHow he does call and pound!\r\n\r\nNow he's crying for an axe.\r\n\r\nIt would be a shame to break down that beautiful door!\r\n\r\n\"John dear!\" said I in the gentlest voice, \"the key is down by the front\r\nsteps, under a plantain leaf!\"\r\n\r\nThat silenced him for a few moments.\r\n\r\nThen he said--very quietly indeed, \"Open the door, my darling!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" said I. \"The key is down by the front door under a plantain\r\nleaf!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and\r\nsaid it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it of course, and\r\ncame in. He stopped short by the door.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" he cried. \"For God's sake, what are you doing!\"\r\n\r\nI kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I've got out at last,\" said I, \"in spite of you and Jane. And I've\r\npulled off most of the paper, so you can't put me back!\"\r\n\r\nNow why should that man have fainted? But he did, and right across my\r\npath by the wall, so that I had to creep over him every time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Yellow Wallpaper, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE YELLOW WALLPAPER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1952.txt or 1952.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/5/1952/\r\n\r\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n", "author": "Charlotte Perkins Gilman", "tags": ["1001", "1001 books", "19th century", "American", "American literature", "classic", "classics", "depression", "ebook", "feminism", "feminist", "fiction", "gothic", "horror", "Kindle", "literature", "madness", "mental health", "mental illness", "novel", "psychology", "read", "short stories", "short story", "Victorian", "Virago", "Virago Modern Classics", "women"], "title": "The Yellow Wallpaper"}, {"text": "\ufeffProject Gutenberg's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, by Washington Irving\r\n\r\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\r\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

(Kingsley) Newby and Greg Newby\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nby Washington Irving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUND AMONG THE PAPERS OF THE LATE DIEDRICH KNICKERBOCKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n        A pleasing land of drowsy head it was,\r\n          Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye;\r\n        And of gay castles in the clouds that pass,\r\n          Forever flushing round a summer sky.\r\n                                         CASTLE OF INDOLENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern\r\nshore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated\r\nby the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee, and where they always\r\nprudently shortened sail and implored the protection of St. Nicholas\r\nwhen they crossed, there lies a small market town or rural port, which\r\nby some is called Greensburgh, but which is more generally and properly\r\nknown by the name of Tarry Town. This name was given, we are told, in\r\nformer days, by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the\r\ninveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village\r\ntavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do not vouch for the fact,\r\nbut merely advert to it, for the sake of being precise and authentic.\r\nNot far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little\r\nvalley or rather lap of land among high hills, which is one of the\r\nquietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it,\r\nwith just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional\r\nwhistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound\r\nthat ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity.\r\n\r\nI recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in\r\nsquirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one\r\nside of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature\r\nis peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it\r\nbroke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated\r\nby the angry echoes. If ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might\r\nsteal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the\r\nremnant of a troubled life, I know of none more promising than this\r\nlittle valley.\r\n\r\nFrom the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of its\r\ninhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this\r\nsequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW, and\r\nits rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the\r\nneighboring country. A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the\r\nland, and to pervade the very atmosphere. Some say that the place\r\nwas bewitched by a High German doctor, during the early days of the\r\nsettlement; others, that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of\r\nhis tribe, held his powwows there before the country was discovered by\r\nMaster Hendrick Hudson. Certain it is, the place still continues under\r\nthe sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds of\r\nthe good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie. They are\r\ngiven to all kinds of marvellous beliefs, are subject to trances and\r\nvisions, and frequently see strange sights, and hear music and voices in\r\nthe air. The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots,\r\nand twilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across\r\nthe valley than in any other part of the country, and the nightmare,\r\nwith her whole ninefold, seems to make it the favorite scene of her\r\ngambols.\r\n\r\nThe dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and\r\nseems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the\r\napparition of a figure on horseback, without a head. It is said by some\r\nto be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away\r\nby a cannon-ball, in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War,\r\nand who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in\r\nthe gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not\r\nconfined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and\r\nespecially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed,\r\ncertain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been\r\ncareful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this\r\nspectre, allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the\r\nchurchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly\r\nquest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes\r\npasses along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being\r\nbelated, and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has\r\nfurnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows; and\r\nthe spectre is known at all the country firesides, by the name of the\r\nHeadless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not\r\nconfined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but is unconsciously\r\nimbibed by every one who resides there for a time. However wide awake\r\nthey may have been before they entered that sleepy region, they are\r\nsure, in a little time, to inhale the witching influence of the air, and\r\nbegin to grow imaginative, to dream dreams, and see apparitions.\r\n\r\nI mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud, for it is in such\r\nlittle retired Dutch valleys, found here and there embosomed in the\r\ngreat State of New York, that population, manners, and customs remain\r\nfixed, while the great torrent of migration and improvement, which is\r\nmaking such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country,\r\nsweeps by them unobserved. They are like those little nooks of still\r\nwater, which border a rapid stream, where we may see the straw and\r\nbubble riding quietly at anchor, or slowly revolving in their mimic\r\nharbor, undisturbed by the rush of the passing current. Though many\r\nyears have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet\r\nI question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same\r\nfamilies vegetating in its sheltered bosom.\r\n\r\nIn this by-place of nature there abode, in a remote period of American\r\nhistory, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy wight of the\r\nname of Ichabod Crane, who sojourned, or, as he expressed it, \"tarried,\"\r\nin Sleepy Hollow, for the purpose of instructing the children of the\r\nvicinity. He was a native of Connecticut, a State which supplies the\r\nUnion with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest, and sends\r\nforth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters.\r\nThe cognomen of Crane was not inapplicable to his person. He was tall,\r\nbut exceedingly lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, hands\r\nthat dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet that might have served for\r\nshovels, and his whole frame most loosely hung together. His head was\r\nsmall, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy eyes, and a\r\nlong snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather-cock perched upon his\r\nspindle neck to tell which way the wind blew. To see him striding along\r\nthe profile of a hill on a windy day, with his clothes bagging and\r\nfluttering about him, one might have mistaken him for the genius of\r\nfamine descending upon the earth, or some scarecrow eloped from a\r\ncornfield.\r\n\r\nHis schoolhouse was a low building of one large room, rudely constructed\r\nof logs; the windows partly glazed, and partly patched with leaves of\r\nold copybooks. It was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours, by a\r\nwithe twisted in the handle of the door, and stakes set against the\r\nwindow shutters; so that though a thief might get in with perfect ease,\r\nhe would find some embarrassment in getting out,--an idea most probably\r\nborrowed by the architect, Yost Van Houten, from the mystery of an\r\neelpot. The schoolhouse stood in a rather lonely but pleasant situation,\r\njust at the foot of a woody hill, with a brook running close by, and\r\na formidable birch-tree growing at one end of it. From hence the low\r\nmurmur of his pupils' voices, conning over their lessons, might be heard\r\nin a drowsy summer's day, like the hum of a beehive; interrupted now and\r\nthen by the authoritative voice of the master, in the tone of menace or\r\ncommand, or, peradventure, by the appalling sound of the birch, as he\r\nurged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge. Truth to\r\nsay, he was a conscientious man, and ever bore in mind the golden maxim,\r\n\"Spare the rod and spoil the child.\" Ichabod Crane's scholars certainly\r\nwere not spoiled.\r\n\r\nI would not have it imagined, however, that he was one of those cruel\r\npotentates of the school who joy in the smart of their subjects; on\r\nthe contrary, he administered justice with discrimination rather than\r\nseverity; taking the burden off the backs of the weak, and laying it on\r\nthose of the strong. Your mere puny stripling, that winced at the least\r\nflourish of the rod, was passed by with indulgence; but the claims of\r\njustice were satisfied by inflicting a double portion on some little\r\ntough wrong-headed, broad-skirted Dutch urchin, who sulked and swelled\r\nand grew dogged and sullen beneath the birch. All this he called \"doing\r\nhis duty by their parents;\" and he never inflicted a chastisement\r\nwithout following it by the assurance, so consolatory to the smarting\r\nurchin, that \"he would remember it and thank him for it the longest day\r\nhe had to live.\"\r\n\r\nWhen school hours were over, he was even the companion and playmate\r\nof the larger boys; and on holiday afternoons would convoy some of\r\nthe smaller ones home, who happened to have pretty sisters, or good\r\nhousewives for mothers, noted for the comforts of the cupboard. Indeed,\r\nit behooved him to keep on good terms with his pupils. The revenue\r\narising from his school was small, and would have been scarcely\r\nsufficient to furnish him with daily bread, for he was a huge feeder,\r\nand, though lank, had the dilating powers of an anaconda; but to help\r\nout his maintenance, he was, according to country custom in those\r\nparts, boarded and lodged at the houses of the farmers whose children\r\nhe instructed. With these he lived successively a week at a time, thus\r\ngoing the rounds of the neighborhood, with all his worldly effects tied\r\nup in a cotton handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThat all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic\r\npatrons, who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous\r\nburden, and schoolmasters as mere drones, he had various ways of\r\nrendering himself both useful and agreeable. He assisted the farmers\r\noccasionally in the lighter labors of their farms, helped to make\r\nhay, mended the fences, took the horses to water, drove the cows from\r\npasture, and cut wood for the winter fire. He laid aside, too, all the\r\ndominant dignity and absolute sway with which he lorded it in his little\r\nempire, the school, and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating.\r\nHe found favor in the eyes of the mothers by petting the children,\r\nparticularly the youngest; and like the lion bold, which whilom so\r\nmagnanimously the lamb did hold, he would sit with a child on one knee,\r\nand rock a cradle with his foot for whole hours together.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his other vocations, he was the singing-master of the\r\nneighborhood, and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the\r\nyoung folks in psalmody. It was a matter of no little vanity to him on\r\nSundays, to take his station in front of the church gallery, with a band\r\nof chosen singers; where, in his own mind, he completely carried away\r\nthe palm from the parson. Certain it is, his voice resounded far above\r\nall the rest of the congregation; and there are peculiar quavers still\r\nto be heard in that church, and which may even be heard half a mile off,\r\nquite to the opposite side of the millpond, on a still Sunday morning,\r\nwhich are said to be legitimately descended from the nose of Ichabod\r\nCrane. Thus, by divers little makeshifts, in that ingenious way which is\r\ncommonly denominated \"by hook and by crook,\" the worthy pedagogue got on\r\ntolerably enough, and was thought, by all who understood nothing of the\r\nlabor of headwork, to have a wonderfully easy life of it.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in the female\r\ncircle of a rural neighborhood; being considered a kind of idle,\r\ngentlemanlike personage, of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to\r\nthe rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior in learning only to the\r\nparson. His appearance, therefore, is apt to occasion some little stir\r\nat the tea-table of a farmhouse, and the addition of a supernumerary\r\ndish of cakes or sweetmeats, or, peradventure, the parade of a silver\r\nteapot. Our man of letters, therefore, was peculiarly happy in the\r\nsmiles of all the country damsels. How he would figure among them in the\r\nchurchyard, between services on Sundays; gathering grapes for them from\r\nthe wild vines that overran the surrounding trees; reciting for their\r\namusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones; or sauntering, with a\r\nwhole bevy of them, along the banks of the adjacent millpond; while the\r\nmore bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back, envying his superior\r\nelegance and address.\r\n\r\nFrom his half-itinerant life, also, he was a kind of travelling gazette,\r\ncarrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house, so that\r\nhis appearance was always greeted with satisfaction. He was, moreover,\r\nesteemed by the women as a man of great erudition, for he had read\r\nseveral books quite through, and was a perfect master of Cotton Mather's\r\n\"History of New England Witchcraft,\" in which, by the way, he most\r\nfirmly and potently believed.\r\n\r\nHe was, in fact, an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple\r\ncredulity. His appetite for the marvellous, and his powers of digesting\r\nit, were equally extraordinary; and both had been increased by his\r\nresidence in this spell-bound region. No tale was too gross or monstrous\r\nfor his capacious swallow. It was often his delight, after his school\r\nwas dismissed in the afternoon, to stretch himself on the rich bed of\r\nclover bordering the little brook that whimpered by his schoolhouse, and\r\nthere con over old Mather's direful tales, until the gathering dusk of\r\nevening made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes. Then, as he\r\nwended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland, to the farmhouse\r\nwhere he happened to be quartered, every sound of nature, at that\r\nwitching hour, fluttered his excited imagination,--the moan of the\r\nwhip-poor-will from the hillside, the boding cry of the tree toad, that\r\nharbinger of storm, the dreary hooting of the screech owl, or the\r\nsudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost. The\r\nfireflies, too, which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places, now\r\nand then startled him, as one of uncommon brightness would stream across\r\nhis path; and if, by chance, a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging\r\nhis blundering flight against him, the poor varlet was ready to give up\r\nthe ghost, with the idea that he was struck with a witch's token. His\r\nonly resource on such occasions, either to drown thought or drive away\r\nevil spirits, was to sing psalm tunes and the good people of Sleepy\r\nHollow, as they sat by their doors of an evening, were often filled with\r\nawe at hearing his nasal melody, \"in linked sweetness long drawn out,\"\r\nfloating from the distant hill, or along the dusky road.\r\n\r\nAnother of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter\r\nevenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning by the fire,\r\nwith a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth, and\r\nlisten to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins, and haunted\r\nfields, and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and haunted houses,\r\nand particularly of the headless horseman, or Galloping Hessian of the\r\nHollow, as they sometimes called him. He would delight them equally by\r\nhis anecdotes of witchcraft, and of the direful omens and portentous\r\nsights and sounds in the air, which prevailed in the earlier times of\r\nConnecticut; and would frighten them woefully with speculations upon\r\ncomets and shooting stars; and with the alarming fact that the world did\r\nabsolutely turn round, and that they were half the time topsy-turvy!\r\n\r\nBut if there was a pleasure in all this, while snugly cuddling in\r\nthe chimney corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow from the\r\ncrackling wood fire, and where, of course, no spectre dared to show\r\nits face, it was dearly purchased by the terrors of his subsequent walk\r\nhomewards. What fearful shapes and shadows beset his path, amidst the\r\ndim and ghastly glare of a snowy night! With what wistful look did he\r\neye every trembling ray of light streaming across the waste fields from\r\nsome distant window! How often was he appalled by some shrub covered\r\nwith snow, which, like a sheeted spectre, beset his very path! How often\r\ndid he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his own steps on the\r\nfrosty crust beneath his feet; and dread to look over his shoulder, lest\r\nhe should behold some uncouth being tramping close behind him! And how\r\noften was he thrown into complete dismay by some rushing blast, howling\r\namong the trees, in the idea that it was the Galloping Hessian on one of\r\nhis nightly scourings!\r\n\r\nAll these, however, were mere terrors of the night, phantoms of the mind\r\nthat walk in darkness; and though he had seen many spectres in his time,\r\nand been more than once beset by Satan in divers shapes, in his lonely\r\nperambulations, yet daylight put an end to all these evils; and he would\r\nhave passed a pleasant life of it, in despite of the Devil and all his\r\nworks, if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes more\r\nperplexity to mortal man than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race of\r\nwitches put together, and that was--a woman.\r\n\r\nAmong the musical disciples who assembled, one evening in each week,\r\nto receive his instructions in psalmody, was Katrina Van Tassel,\r\nthe daughter and only child of a substantial Dutch farmer. She was a\r\nblooming lass of fresh eighteen; plump as a partridge; ripe and melting\r\nand rosy-cheeked as one of her father's peaches, and universally famed,\r\nnot merely for her beauty, but her vast expectations. She was withal a\r\nlittle of a coquette, as might be perceived even in her dress, which was\r\na mixture of ancient and modern fashions, as most suited to set off\r\nher charms. She wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold, which her\r\ngreat-great-grandmother had brought over from Saardam; the tempting\r\nstomacher of the olden time, and withal a provokingly short petticoat,\r\nto display the prettiest foot and ankle in the country round.\r\n\r\nIchabod Crane had a soft and foolish heart towards the sex; and it is\r\nnot to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his\r\neyes, more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion.\r\nOld Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented,\r\nliberal-hearted farmer. He seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or\r\nhis thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm; but within those\r\neverything was snug, happy and well-conditioned. He was satisfied with\r\nhis wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon the hearty\r\nabundance, rather than the style in which he lived. His stronghold was\r\nsituated on the banks of the Hudson, in one of those green, sheltered,\r\nfertile nooks in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling. A\r\ngreat elm tree spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which\r\nbubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water, in a little well\r\nformed of a barrel; and then stole sparkling away through the grass, to\r\na neighboring brook, that babbled along among alders and dwarf willows.\r\nHard by the farmhouse was a vast barn, that might have served for a\r\nchurch; every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the\r\ntreasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within it from\r\nmorning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the\r\neaves; and rows of pigeons, some with one eye turned up, as if watching\r\nthe weather, some with their heads under their wings or buried in their\r\nbosoms, and others swelling, and cooing, and bowing about their dames,\r\nwere enjoying the sunshine on the roof. Sleek unwieldy porkers were\r\ngrunting in the repose and abundance of their pens, from whence sallied\r\nforth, now and then, troops of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air.\r\nA stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond,\r\nconvoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling\r\nthrough the farmyard, and Guinea fowls fretting about it, like\r\nill-tempered housewives, with their peevish, discontented cry. Before\r\nthe barn door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband, a\r\nwarrior and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings and crowing\r\nin the pride and gladness of his heart,--sometimes tearing up the earth\r\nwith his feet, and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of\r\nwives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered.\r\n\r\nThe pedagogue's mouth watered as he looked upon this sumptuous promise\r\nof luxurious winter fare. In his devouring mind's eye, he pictured to\r\nhimself every roasting-pig running about with a pudding in his belly,\r\nand an apple in his mouth; the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a\r\ncomfortable pie, and tucked in with a coverlet of crust; the geese were\r\nswimming in their own gravy; and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes,\r\nlike snug married couples, with a decent competency of onion sauce. In\r\nthe porkers he saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon, and juicy\r\nrelishing ham; not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed up, with\r\nits gizzard under its wing, and, peradventure, a necklace of savory\r\nsausages; and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back,\r\nin a side dish, with uplifted claws, as if craving that quarter which\r\nhis chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living.\r\n\r\nAs the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and as he rolled his great\r\ngreen eyes over the fat meadow lands, the rich fields of wheat, of rye,\r\nof buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards burdened with ruddy\r\nfruit, which surrounded the warm tenement of Van Tassel, his heart\r\nyearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains, and his\r\nimagination expanded with the idea, how they might be readily turned\r\ninto cash, and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land, and\r\nshingle palaces in the wilderness. Nay, his busy fancy already realized\r\nhis hopes, and presented to him the blooming Katrina, with a whole\r\nfamily of children, mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household\r\ntrumpery, with pots and kettles dangling beneath; and he beheld himself\r\nbestriding a pacing mare, with a colt at her heels, setting out for\r\nKentucky, Tennessee,--or the Lord knows where!\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the house, the conquest of his heart was complete. It\r\nwas one of those spacious farmhouses, with high-ridged but lowly sloping\r\nroofs, built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers; the\r\nlow projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front, capable of being\r\nclosed up in bad weather. Under this were hung flails, harness, various\r\nutensils of husbandry, and nets for fishing in the neighboring\r\nriver. Benches were built along the sides for summer use; and a great\r\nspinning-wheel at one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various\r\nuses to which this important porch might be devoted. From this piazza\r\nthe wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the centre of the\r\nmansion, and the place of usual residence. Here rows of resplendent\r\npewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his eyes. In one corner\r\nstood a huge bag of wool, ready to be spun; in another, a quantity of\r\nlinsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of Indian corn, and strings of\r\ndried apples and peaches, hung in gay festoons along the walls, mingled\r\nwith the gaud of red peppers; and a door left ajar gave him a peep into\r\nthe best parlor, where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables\r\nshone like mirrors; andirons, with their accompanying shovel and\r\ntongs, glistened from their covert of asparagus tops; mock-oranges and\r\nconch-shells decorated the mantelpiece; strings of various-colored birds\r\neggs were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung from\r\nthe centre of the room, and a corner cupboard, knowingly left open,\r\ndisplayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of delight, the\r\npeace of his mind was at an end, and his only study was how to gain the\r\naffections of the peerless daughter of Van Tassel. In this enterprise,\r\nhowever, he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of\r\na knight-errant of yore, who seldom had anything but giants, enchanters,\r\nfiery dragons, and such like easily conquered adversaries, to contend\r\nwith and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass,\r\nand walls of adamant to the castle keep, where the lady of his heart was\r\nconfined; all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way\r\nto the centre of a Christmas pie; and then the lady gave him her hand as\r\na matter of course. Ichabod, on the contrary, had to win his way to\r\nthe heart of a country coquette, beset with a labyrinth of whims\r\nand caprices, which were forever presenting new difficulties and\r\nimpediments; and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries of\r\nreal flesh and blood, the numerous rustic admirers, who beset every\r\nportal to her heart, keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other,\r\nbut ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor.\r\n\r\nAmong these, the most formidable was a burly, roaring, roystering blade,\r\nof the name of Abraham, or, according to the Dutch abbreviation, Brom\r\nVan Brunt, the hero of the country round, which rang with his feats of\r\nstrength and hardihood. He was broad-shouldered and double-jointed,\r\nwith short curly black hair, and a bluff but not unpleasant countenance,\r\nhaving a mingled air of fun and arrogance. From his Herculean frame\r\nand great powers of limb he had received the nickname of BROM BONES,\r\nby which he was universally known. He was famed for great knowledge and\r\nskill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on horseback as a Tartar.\r\nHe was foremost at all races and cock fights; and, with the ascendancy\r\nwhich bodily strength always acquires in rustic life, was the umpire in\r\nall disputes, setting his hat on one side, and giving his decisions with\r\nan air and tone that admitted of no gainsay or appeal. He was always\r\nready for either a fight or a frolic; but had more mischief than\r\nill-will in his composition; and with all his overbearing roughness,\r\nthere was a strong dash of waggish good humor at bottom. He had three or\r\nfour boon companions, who regarded him as their model, and at the\r\nhead of whom he scoured the country, attending every scene of feud or\r\nmerriment for miles round. In cold weather he was distinguished by a\r\nfur cap, surmounted with a flaunting fox's tail; and when the folks at a\r\ncountry gathering descried this well-known crest at a distance, whisking\r\nabout among a squad of hard riders, they always stood by for a squall.\r\nSometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farmhouses at\r\nmidnight, with whoop and halloo, like a troop of Don Cossacks; and the\r\nold dames, startled out of their sleep, would listen for a moment till\r\nthe hurry-scurry had clattered by, and then exclaim, \"Ay, there goes\r\nBrom Bones and his gang!\" The neighbors looked upon him with a mixture\r\nof awe, admiration, and good-will; and, when any madcap prank or rustic\r\nbrawl occurred in the vicinity, always shook their heads, and warranted\r\nBrom Bones was at the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nThis rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming Katrina\r\nfor the object of his uncouth gallantries, and though his amorous\r\ntoyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments of a\r\nbear, yet it was whispered that she did not altogether discourage his\r\nhopes. Certain it is, his advances were signals for rival candidates to\r\nretire, who felt no inclination to cross a lion in his amours; insomuch,\r\nthat when his horse was seen tied to Van Tassel's paling, on a Sunday\r\nnight, a sure sign that his master was courting, or, as it is termed,\r\n\"sparking,\" within, all other suitors passed by in despair, and carried\r\nthe war into other quarters.\r\n\r\nSuch was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had to contend,\r\nand, considering all things, a stouter man than he would have shrunk\r\nfrom the competition, and a wiser man would have despaired. He had,\r\nhowever, a happy mixture of pliability and perseverance in his nature;\r\nhe was in form and spirit like a supple-jack--yielding, but tough;\r\nthough he bent, he never broke; and though he bowed beneath the\r\nslightest pressure, yet, the moment it was away--jerk!--he was as erect,\r\nand carried his head as high as ever.\r\n\r\nTo have taken the field openly against his rival would have been\r\nmadness; for he was not a man to be thwarted in his amours, any more\r\nthan that stormy lover, Achilles. Ichabod, therefore, made his advances\r\nin a quiet and gently insinuating manner. Under cover of his character\r\nof singing-master, he made frequent visits at the farmhouse; not that he\r\nhad anything to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents,\r\nwhich is so often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers. Balt Van\r\nTassel was an easy indulgent soul; he loved his daughter better even\r\nthan his pipe, and, like a reasonable man and an excellent father, let\r\nher have her way in everything. His notable little wife, too, had enough\r\nto do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her poultry; for, as she\r\nsagely observed, ducks and geese are foolish things, and must be looked\r\nafter, but girls can take care of themselves. Thus, while the busy dame\r\nbustled about the house, or plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the\r\npiazza, honest Balt would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other,\r\nwatching the achievements of a little wooden warrior, who, armed with a\r\nsword in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle\r\nof the barn. In the mean time, Ichabod would carry on his suit with the\r\ndaughter by the side of the spring under the great elm, or sauntering\r\nalong in the twilight, that hour so favorable to the lover's eloquence.\r\n\r\nI profess not to know how women's hearts are wooed and won. To me they\r\nhave always been matters of riddle and admiration. Some seem to have but\r\none vulnerable point, or door of access; while others have a thousand\r\navenues, and may be captured in a thousand different ways. It is a\r\ngreat triumph of skill to gain the former, but a still greater proof of\r\ngeneralship to maintain possession of the latter, for man must battle\r\nfor his fortress at every door and window. He who wins a thousand common\r\nhearts is therefore entitled to some renown; but he who keeps undisputed\r\nsway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero. Certain it is, this\r\nwas not the case with the redoubtable Brom Bones; and from the moment\r\nIchabod Crane made his advances, the interests of the former evidently\r\ndeclined: his horse was no longer seen tied to the palings on Sunday\r\nnights, and a deadly feud gradually arose between him and the preceptor\r\nof Sleepy Hollow.\r\n\r\nBrom, who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature, would fain have\r\ncarried matters to open warfare and have settled their pretensions\r\nto the lady, according to the mode of those most concise and simple\r\nreasoners, the knights-errant of yore,--by single combat; but Ichabod\r\nwas too conscious of the superior might of his adversary to enter the\r\nlists against him; he had overheard a boast of Bones, that he would\r\n\"double the schoolmaster up, and lay him on a shelf of his own\r\nschoolhouse;\" and he was too wary to give him an opportunity. There was\r\nsomething extremely provoking in this obstinately pacific system; it\r\nleft Brom no alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in\r\nhis disposition, and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival.\r\nIchabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones and his gang\r\nof rough riders. They harried his hitherto peaceful domains; smoked\r\nout his singing school by stopping up the chimney; broke into the\r\nschoolhouse at night, in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe\r\nand window stakes, and turned everything topsy-turvy, so that the poor\r\nschoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held\r\ntheir meetings there. But what was still more annoying, Brom took all\r\nopportunities of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress,\r\nand had a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous\r\nmanner, and introduced as a rival of Ichabod's, to instruct her in\r\npsalmody.\r\n\r\nIn this way matters went on for some time, without producing any\r\nmaterial effect on the relative situations of the contending powers. On\r\na fine autumnal afternoon, Ichabod, in pensive mood, sat enthroned on\r\nthe lofty stool from whence he usually watched all the concerns of his\r\nlittle literary realm. In his hand he swayed a ferule, that sceptre of\r\ndespotic power; the birch of justice reposed on three nails behind the\r\nthrone, a constant terror to evil doers, while on the desk before\r\nhim might be seen sundry contraband articles and prohibited weapons,\r\ndetected upon the persons of idle urchins, such as half-munched apples,\r\npopguns, whirligigs, fly-cages, and whole legions of rampant little\r\npaper gamecocks. Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice\r\nrecently inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their\r\nbooks, or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the\r\nmaster; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the\r\nschoolroom. It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro in\r\ntow-cloth jacket and trowsers, a round-crowned fragment of a hat,\r\nlike the cap of Mercury, and mounted on the back of a ragged, wild,\r\nhalf-broken colt, which he managed with a rope by way of halter. He came\r\nclattering up to the school door with an invitation to Ichabod to attend\r\na merry-making or \"quilting frolic,\" to be held that evening at\r\nMynheer Van Tassel's; and having delivered his message with that air of\r\nimportance, and effort at fine language, which a negro is apt to display\r\non petty embassies of the kind, he dashed over the brook, and was seen\r\nscampering away up the hollow, full of the importance and hurry of his\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nAll was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet schoolroom. The scholars\r\nwere hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles; those\r\nwho were nimble skipped over half with impunity, and those who were\r\ntardy had a smart application now and then in the rear, to quicken their\r\nspeed or help them over a tall word. Books were flung aside without\r\nbeing put away on the shelves, inkstands were overturned, benches thrown\r\ndown, and the whole school was turned loose an hour before the usual\r\ntime, bursting forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing\r\nabout the green in joy at their early emancipation.\r\n\r\nThe gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at his toilet,\r\nbrushing and furbishing up his best, and indeed only suit of rusty\r\nblack, and arranging his locks by a bit of broken looking-glass that\r\nhung up in the schoolhouse. That he might make his appearance before his\r\nmistress in the true style of a cavalier, he borrowed a horse from the\r\nfarmer with whom he was domiciliated, a choleric old Dutchman of the\r\nname of Hans Van Ripper, and, thus gallantly mounted, issued forth like\r\na knight-errant in quest of adventures. But it is meet I should, in\r\nthe true spirit of romantic story, give some account of the looks\r\nand equipments of my hero and his steed. The animal he bestrode was\r\na broken-down plow-horse, that had outlived almost everything but its\r\nviciousness. He was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe neck, and a head like\r\na hammer; his rusty mane and tail were tangled and knotted with burs;\r\none eye had lost its pupil, and was glaring and spectral, but the other\r\nhad the gleam of a genuine devil in it. Still he must have had fire and\r\nmettle in his day, if we may judge from the name he bore of Gunpowder.\r\nHe had, in fact, been a favorite steed of his master's, the choleric Van\r\nRipper, who was a furious rider, and had infused, very probably, some of\r\nhis own spirit into the animal; for, old and broken-down as he looked,\r\nthere was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nIchabod was a suitable figure for such a steed. He rode with short\r\nstirrups, which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle;\r\nhis sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers'; he carried his whip\r\nperpendicularly in his hand, like a sceptre, and as his horse jogged on,\r\nthe motion of his arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of wings. A\r\nsmall wool hat rested on the top of his nose, for so his scanty strip of\r\nforehead might be called, and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out\r\nalmost to the horses tail. Such was the appearance of Ichabod and his\r\nsteed as they shambled out of the gate of Hans Van Ripper, and it was\r\naltogether such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nIt was, as I have said, a fine autumnal day; the sky was clear and\r\nserene, and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we always\r\nassociate with the idea of abundance. The forests had put on their sober\r\nbrown and yellow, while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped\r\nby the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange, purple, and scarlet.\r\nStreaming files of wild ducks began to make their appearance high in the\r\nair; the bark of the squirrel might be heard from the groves of beech\r\nand hickory-nuts, and the pensive whistle of the quail at intervals from\r\nthe neighboring stubble field.\r\n\r\nThe small birds were taking their farewell banquets. In the fullness\r\nof their revelry, they fluttered, chirping and frolicking from bush to\r\nbush, and tree to tree, capricious from the very profusion and variety\r\naround them. There was the honest cock robin, the favorite game of\r\nstripling sportsmen, with its loud querulous note; and the twittering\r\nblackbirds flying in sable clouds; and the golden-winged woodpecker with\r\nhis crimson crest, his broad black gorget, and splendid plumage; and the\r\ncedar bird, with its red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail and its little\r\nmonteiro cap of feathers; and the blue jay, that noisy coxcomb, in his\r\ngay light blue coat and white underclothes, screaming and chattering,\r\nnodding and bobbing and bowing, and pretending to be on good terms with\r\nevery songster of the grove.\r\n\r\nAs Ichabod jogged slowly on his way, his eye, ever open to every symptom\r\nof culinary abundance, ranged with delight over the treasures of jolly\r\nautumn. On all sides he beheld vast store of apples; some hanging in\r\noppressive opulence on the trees; some gathered into baskets and barrels\r\nfor the market; others heaped up in rich piles for the cider-press.\r\nFarther on he beheld great fields of Indian corn, with its golden ears\r\npeeping from their leafy coverts, and holding out the promise of cakes\r\nand hasty-pudding; and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them, turning\r\nup their fair round bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects of\r\nthe most luxurious of pies; and anon he passed the fragrant buckwheat\r\nfields breathing the odor of the beehive, and as he beheld them, soft\r\nanticipations stole over his mind of dainty slapjacks, well buttered,\r\nand garnished with honey or treacle, by the delicate little dimpled hand\r\nof Katrina Van Tassel.\r\n\r\nThus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts and \"sugared\r\nsuppositions,\" he journeyed along the sides of a range of hills which\r\nlook out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty Hudson. The sun\r\ngradually wheeled his broad disk down in the west. The wide bosom of the\r\nTappan Zee lay motionless and glassy, excepting that here and there a\r\ngentle undulation waved and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant\r\nmountain. A few amber clouds floated in the sky, without a breath of air\r\nto move them. The horizon was of a fine golden tint, changing gradually\r\ninto a pure apple green, and from that into the deep blue of the\r\nmid-heaven. A slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the\r\nprecipices that overhung some parts of the river, giving greater depth\r\nto the dark gray and purple of their rocky sides. A sloop was loitering\r\nin the distance, dropping slowly down with the tide, her sail hanging\r\nuselessly against the mast; and as the reflection of the sky gleamed\r\nalong the still water, it seemed as if the vessel was suspended in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nIt was toward evening that Ichabod arrived at the castle of the Heer\r\nVan Tassel, which he found thronged with the pride and flower of the\r\nadjacent country. Old farmers, a spare leathern-faced race, in homespun\r\ncoats and breeches, blue stockings, huge shoes, and magnificent pewter\r\nbuckles. Their brisk, withered little dames, in close-crimped caps,\r\nlong-waisted short gowns, homespun petticoats, with scissors and\r\npincushions, and gay calico pockets hanging on the outside. Buxom\r\nlasses, almost as antiquated as their mothers, excepting where a straw\r\nhat, a fine ribbon, or perhaps a white frock, gave symptoms of city\r\ninnovation. The sons, in short square-skirted coats, with rows of\r\nstupendous brass buttons, and their hair generally queued in the fashion\r\nof the times, especially if they could procure an eel-skin for the\r\npurpose, it being esteemed throughout the country as a potent nourisher\r\nand strengthener of the hair.\r\n\r\nBrom Bones, however, was the hero of the scene, having come to the\r\ngathering on his favorite steed Daredevil, a creature, like himself,\r\nfull of mettle and mischief, and which no one but himself could manage.\r\nHe was, in fact, noted for preferring vicious animals, given to all\r\nkinds of tricks which kept the rider in constant risk of his neck, for\r\nhe held a tractable, well-broken horse as unworthy of a lad of spirit.\r\n\r\nFain would I pause to dwell upon the world of charms that burst upon\r\nthe enraptured gaze of my hero, as he entered the state parlor of Van\r\nTassel's mansion. Not those of the bevy of buxom lasses, with their\r\nluxurious display of red and white; but the ample charms of a genuine\r\nDutch country tea-table, in the sumptuous time of autumn. Such heaped up\r\nplatters of cakes of various and almost indescribable kinds, known only\r\nto experienced Dutch housewives! There was the doughty doughnut, the\r\ntender oly koek, and the crisp and crumbling cruller; sweet cakes and\r\nshort cakes, ginger cakes and honey cakes, and the whole family of\r\ncakes. And then there were apple pies, and peach pies, and pumpkin pies;\r\nbesides slices of ham and smoked beef; and moreover delectable dishes\r\nof preserved plums, and peaches, and pears, and quinces; not to mention\r\nbroiled shad and roasted chickens; together with bowls of milk and\r\ncream, all mingled higgledy-piggledy, pretty much as I have enumerated\r\nthem, with the motherly teapot sending up its clouds of vapor from the\r\nmidst--Heaven bless the mark! I want breath and time to discuss this\r\nbanquet as it deserves, and am too eager to get on with my story.\r\nHappily, Ichabod Crane was not in so great a hurry as his historian, but\r\ndid ample justice to every dainty.\r\n\r\nHe was a kind and thankful creature, whose heart dilated in proportion\r\nas his skin was filled with good cheer, and whose spirits rose with\r\neating, as some men's do with drink. He could not help, too, rolling his\r\nlarge eyes round him as he ate, and chuckling with the possibility that\r\nhe might one day be lord of all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury\r\nand splendor. Then, he thought, how soon he'd turn his back upon the old\r\nschoolhouse; snap his fingers in the face of Hans Van Ripper, and every\r\nother niggardly patron, and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of doors\r\nthat should dare to call him comrade!\r\n\r\nOld Baltus Van Tassel moved about among his guests with a face dilated\r\nwith content and good humor, round and jolly as the harvest moon. His\r\nhospitable attentions were brief, but expressive, being confined to a\r\nshake of the hand, a slap on the shoulder, a loud laugh, and a pressing\r\ninvitation to \"fall to, and help themselves.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the sound of the music from the common room, or hall, summoned\r\nto the dance. The musician was an old gray-headed negro, who had\r\nbeen the itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood for more than half a\r\ncentury. His instrument was as old and battered as himself. The greater\r\npart of the time he scraped on two or three strings, accompanying every\r\nmovement of the bow with a motion of the head; bowing almost to the\r\nground, and stamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple were to\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nIchabod prided himself upon his dancing as much as upon his vocal\r\npowers. Not a limb, not a fibre about him was idle; and to have seen his\r\nloosely hung frame in full motion, and clattering about the room, you\r\nwould have thought St. Vitus himself, that blessed patron of the dance,\r\nwas figuring before you in person. He was the admiration of all the\r\nnegroes; who, having gathered, of all ages and sizes, from the farm\r\nand the neighborhood, stood forming a pyramid of shining black faces at\r\nevery door and window, gazing with delight at the scene, rolling their\r\nwhite eyeballs, and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear. How\r\ncould the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and joyous? The\r\nlady of his heart was his partner in the dance, and smiling graciously\r\nin reply to all his amorous oglings; while Brom Bones, sorely smitten\r\nwith love and jealousy, sat brooding by himself in one corner.\r\n\r\nWhen the dance was at an end, Ichabod was attracted to a knot of the\r\nsager folks, who, with Old Van Tassel, sat smoking at one end of the\r\npiazza, gossiping over former times, and drawing out long stories about\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nThis neighborhood, at the time of which I am speaking, was one of those\r\nhighly favored places which abound with chronicle and great men. The\r\nBritish and American line had run near it during the war; it had,\r\ntherefore, been the scene of marauding and infested with refugees,\r\ncowboys, and all kinds of border chivalry. Just sufficient time had\r\nelapsed to enable each storyteller to dress up his tale with a little\r\nbecoming fiction, and, in the indistinctness of his recollection, to\r\nmake himself the hero of every exploit.\r\n\r\nThere was the story of Doffue Martling, a large blue-bearded Dutchman,\r\nwho had nearly taken a British frigate with an old iron nine-pounder\r\nfrom a mud breastwork, only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge.\r\nAnd there was an old gentleman who shall be nameless, being too rich\r\na mynheer to be lightly mentioned, who, in the battle of White Plains,\r\nbeing an excellent master of defence, parried a musket-ball with a small\r\nsword, insomuch that he absolutely felt it whiz round the blade, and\r\nglance off at the hilt; in proof of which he was ready at any time to\r\nshow the sword, with the hilt a little bent. There were several more\r\nthat had been equally great in the field, not one of whom but was\r\npersuaded that he had a considerable hand in bringing the war to a happy\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nBut all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and apparitions that\r\nsucceeded. The neighborhood is rich in legendary treasures of the\r\nkind. Local tales and superstitions thrive best in these sheltered,\r\nlong-settled retreats; but are trampled under foot by the shifting\r\nthrong that forms the population of most of our country places. Besides,\r\nthere is no encouragement for ghosts in most of our villages, for they\r\nhave scarcely had time to finish their first nap and turn themselves in\r\ntheir graves, before their surviving friends have travelled away from\r\nthe neighborhood; so that when they turn out at night to walk their\r\nrounds, they have no acquaintance left to call upon. This is perhaps the\r\nreason why we so seldom hear of ghosts except in our long-established\r\nDutch communities.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause, however, of the prevalence of supernatural stories\r\nin these parts, was doubtless owing to the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow.\r\nThere was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted\r\nregion; it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting\r\nall the land. Several of the Sleepy Hollow people were present at\r\nVan Tassel's, and, as usual, were doling out their wild and wonderful\r\nlegends. Many dismal tales were told about funeral trains, and mourning\r\ncries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the\r\nunfortunate Major Andr\u00e9 was taken, and which stood in the neighborhood.\r\nSome mention was made also of the woman in white, that haunted the\r\ndark glen at Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on winter nights\r\nbefore a storm, having perished there in the snow. The chief part of the\r\nstories, however, turned upon the favorite spectre of Sleepy Hollow, the\r\nHeadless Horseman, who had been heard several times of late, patrolling\r\nthe country; and, it was said, tethered his horse nightly among the\r\ngraves in the churchyard.\r\n\r\nThe sequestered situation of this church seems always to have made it a\r\nfavorite haunt of troubled spirits. It stands on a knoll, surrounded by\r\nlocust-trees and lofty elms, from among which its decent, whitewashed\r\nwalls shine modestly forth, like Christian purity beaming through the\r\nshades of retirement. A gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet\r\nof water, bordered by high trees, between which, peeps may be caught at\r\nthe blue hills of the Hudson. To look upon its grass-grown yard, where\r\nthe sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly, one would think that there at\r\nleast the dead might rest in peace. On one side of the church extends a\r\nwide woody dell, along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and\r\ntrunks of fallen trees. Over a deep black part of the stream, not far\r\nfrom the church, was formerly thrown a wooden bridge; the road that led\r\nto it, and the bridge itself, were thickly shaded by overhanging trees,\r\nwhich cast a gloom about it, even in the daytime; but occasioned a\r\nfearful darkness at night. Such was one of the favorite haunts of\r\nthe Headless Horseman, and the place where he was most frequently\r\nencountered. The tale was told of old Brouwer, a most heretical\r\ndisbeliever in ghosts, how he met the Horseman returning from his foray\r\ninto Sleepy Hollow, and was obliged to get up behind him; how they\r\ngalloped over bush and brake, over hill and swamp, until they reached\r\nthe bridge; when the Horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton, threw old\r\nBrouwer into the brook, and sprang away over the tree-tops with a clap\r\nof thunder.\r\n\r\nThis story was immediately matched by a thrice marvellous adventure of\r\nBrom Bones, who made light of the Galloping Hessian as an arrant jockey.\r\nHe affirmed that on returning one night from the neighboring village of\r\nSing Sing, he had been overtaken by this midnight trooper; that he had\r\noffered to race with him for a bowl of punch, and should have won it\r\ntoo, for Daredevil beat the goblin horse all hollow, but just as they\r\ncame to the church bridge, the Hessian bolted, and vanished in a flash\r\nof fire.\r\n\r\nAll these tales, told in that drowsy undertone with which men talk in\r\nthe dark, the countenances of the listeners only now and then receiving\r\na casual gleam from the glare of a pipe, sank deep in the mind of\r\nIchabod. He repaid them in kind with large extracts from his invaluable\r\nauthor, Cotton Mather, and added many marvellous events that had taken\r\nplace in his native State of Connecticut, and fearful sights which he\r\nhad seen in his nightly walks about Sleepy Hollow.\r\n\r\nThe revel now gradually broke up. The old farmers gathered together\r\ntheir families in their wagons, and were heard for some time rattling\r\nalong the hollow roads, and over the distant hills. Some of the\r\ndamsels mounted on pillions behind their favorite swains, and their\r\nlight-hearted laughter, mingling with the clatter of hoofs, echoed along\r\nthe silent woodlands, sounding fainter and fainter, until they gradually\r\ndied away,--and the late scene of noise and frolic was all silent and\r\ndeserted. Ichabod only lingered behind, according to the custom of\r\ncountry lovers, to have a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the heiress; fully convinced\r\nthat he was now on the high road to success. What passed at this\r\ninterview I will not pretend to say, for in fact I do not know.\r\nSomething, however, I fear me, must have gone wrong, for he certainly\r\nsallied forth, after no very great interval, with an air quite desolate\r\nand chapfallen. Oh, these women! these women! Could that girl have been\r\nplaying off any of her coquettish tricks? Was her encouragement of the\r\npoor pedagogue all a mere sham to secure her conquest of his rival?\r\nHeaven only knows, not I! Let it suffice to say, Ichabod stole forth\r\nwith the air of one who had been sacking a henroost, rather than a fair\r\nlady's heart. Without looking to the right or left to notice the scene\r\nof rural wealth, on which he had so often gloated, he went straight to\r\nthe stable, and with several hearty cuffs and kicks roused his steed\r\nmost uncourteously from the comfortable quarters in which he was soundly\r\nsleeping, dreaming of mountains of corn and oats, and whole valleys of\r\ntimothy and clover.\r\n\r\nIt was the very witching time of night that Ichabod, heavy-hearted and\r\ncrestfallen, pursued his travels homewards, along the sides of the\r\nlofty hills which rise above Tarry Town, and which he had traversed so\r\ncheerily in the afternoon. The hour was as dismal as himself. Far below\r\nhim the Tappan Zee spread its dusky and indistinct waste of waters, with\r\nhere and there the tall mast of a sloop, riding quietly at anchor under\r\nthe land. In the dead hush of midnight, he could even hear the barking\r\nof the watchdog from the opposite shore of the Hudson; but it was\r\nso vague and faint as only to give an idea of his distance from this\r\nfaithful companion of man. Now and then, too, the long-drawn crowing\r\nof a cock, accidentally awakened, would sound far, far off, from some\r\nfarmhouse away among the hills--but it was like a dreaming sound in his\r\near. No signs of life occurred near him, but occasionally the melancholy\r\nchirp of a cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of a bullfrog from a\r\nneighboring marsh, as if sleeping uncomfortably and turning suddenly in\r\nhis bed.\r\n\r\nAll the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had heard in the afternoon\r\nnow came crowding upon his recollection. The night grew darker and\r\ndarker; the stars seemed to sink deeper in the sky, and driving clouds\r\noccasionally hid them from his sight. He had never felt so lonely and\r\ndismal. He was, moreover, approaching the very place where many of the\r\nscenes of the ghost stories had been laid. In the centre of the road\r\nstood an enormous tulip-tree, which towered like a giant above all the\r\nother trees of the neighborhood, and formed a kind of landmark. Its\r\nlimbs were gnarled and fantastic, large enough to form trunks for\r\nordinary trees, twisting down almost to the earth, and rising again into\r\nthe air. It was connected with the tragical story of the unfortunate\r\nAndr\u00e9, who had been taken prisoner hard by; and was universally known\r\nby the name of Major Andr\u00e9's tree. The common people regarded it with a\r\nmixture of respect and superstition, partly out of sympathy for the\r\nfate of its ill-starred namesake, and partly from the tales of strange\r\nsights, and doleful lamentations, told concerning it.\r\n\r\nAs Ichabod approached this fearful tree, he began to whistle; he thought\r\nhis whistle was answered; it was but a blast sweeping sharply through\r\nthe dry branches. As he approached a little nearer, he thought he saw\r\nsomething white, hanging in the midst of the tree: he paused and ceased\r\nwhistling but, on looking more narrowly, perceived that it was a place\r\nwhere the tree had been scathed by lightning, and the white wood laid\r\nbare. Suddenly he heard a groan--his teeth chattered, and his knees\r\nsmote against the saddle: it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon\r\nanother, as they were swayed about by the breeze. He passed the tree in\r\nsafety, but new perils lay before him.\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred yards from the tree, a small brook crossed the road,\r\nand ran into a marshy and thickly-wooded glen, known by the name of\r\nWiley's Swamp. A few rough logs, laid side by side, served for a bridge\r\nover this stream. On that side of the road where the brook entered the\r\nwood, a group of oaks and chestnuts, matted thick with wild grape-vines,\r\nthrew a cavernous gloom over it. To pass this bridge was the severest\r\ntrial. It was at this identical spot that the unfortunate Andr\u00e9 was\r\ncaptured, and under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the\r\nsturdy yeomen concealed who surprised him. This has ever since been\r\nconsidered a haunted stream, and fearful are the feelings of the\r\nschoolboy who has to pass it alone after dark.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the stream, his heart began to thump; he summoned up,\r\nhowever, all his resolution, gave his horse half a score of kicks in the\r\nribs, and attempted to dash briskly across the bridge; but instead of\r\nstarting forward, the perverse old animal made a lateral movement, and\r\nran broadside against the fence. Ichabod, whose fears increased with the\r\ndelay, jerked the reins on the other side, and kicked lustily with the\r\ncontrary foot: it was all in vain; his steed started, it is true, but\r\nit was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of\r\nbrambles and alder bushes. The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and\r\nheel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed forward,\r\nsnuffling and snorting, but came to a stand just by the bridge, with a\r\nsuddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his head.\r\nJust at this moment a plashy tramp by the side of the bridge caught the\r\nsensitive ear of Ichabod. In the dark shadow of the grove, on the margin\r\nof the brook, he beheld something huge, misshapen and towering. It\r\nstirred not, but seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic\r\nmonster ready to spring upon the traveller.\r\n\r\nThe hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head with terror.\r\nWhat was to be done? To turn and fly was now too late; and besides,\r\nwhat chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin, if such it was, which\r\ncould ride upon the wings of the wind? Summoning up, therefore, a\r\nshow of courage, he demanded in stammering accents, \"Who are you?\"\r\nHe received no reply. He repeated his demand in a still more agitated\r\nvoice. Still there was no answer. Once more he cudgelled the sides\r\nof the inflexible Gunpowder, and, shutting his eyes, broke forth with\r\ninvoluntary fervor into a psalm tune. Just then the shadowy object of\r\nalarm put itself in motion, and with a scramble and a bound stood at\r\nonce in the middle of the road. Though the night was dark and dismal,\r\nyet the form of the unknown might now in some degree be ascertained. He\r\nappeared to be a horseman of large dimensions, and mounted on a black\r\nhorse of powerful frame. He made no offer of molestation or sociability,\r\nbut kept aloof on one side of the road, jogging along on the blind side\r\nof old Gunpowder, who had now got over his fright and waywardness.\r\n\r\nIchabod, who had no relish for this strange midnight companion, and\r\nbethought himself of the adventure of Brom Bones with the Galloping\r\nHessian, now quickened his steed in hopes of leaving him behind. The\r\nstranger, however, quickened his horse to an equal pace. Ichabod pulled\r\nup, and fell into a walk, thinking to lag behind,--the other did the\r\nsame. His heart began to sink within him; he endeavored to resume his\r\npsalm tune, but his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and\r\nhe could not utter a stave. There was something in the moody and\r\ndogged silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and\r\nappalling. It was soon fearfully accounted for. On mounting a rising\r\nground, which brought the figure of his fellow-traveller in relief\r\nagainst the sky, gigantic in height, and muffled in a cloak, Ichabod was\r\nhorror-struck on perceiving that he was headless!--but his horror was\r\nstill more increased on observing that the head, which should have\r\nrested on his shoulders, was carried before him on the pommel of his\r\nsaddle! His terror rose to desperation; he rained a shower of kicks and\r\nblows upon Gunpowder, hoping by a sudden movement to give his companion\r\nthe slip; but the spectre started full jump with him. Away, then, they\r\ndashed through thick and thin; stones flying and sparks flashing at\r\nevery bound. Ichabod's flimsy garments fluttered in the air, as\r\nhe stretched his long lank body away over his horse's head, in the\r\neagerness of his flight.\r\n\r\nThey had now reached the road which turns off to Sleepy Hollow; but\r\nGunpowder, who seemed possessed with a demon, instead of keeping up it,\r\nmade an opposite turn, and plunged headlong downhill to the left. This\r\nroad leads through a sandy hollow shaded by trees for about a quarter\r\nof a mile, where it crosses the bridge famous in goblin story; and just\r\nbeyond swells the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church.\r\n\r\nAs yet the panic of the steed had given his unskilful rider an apparent\r\nadvantage in the chase, but just as he had got half way through the\r\nhollow, the girths of the saddle gave way, and he felt it slipping from\r\nunder him. He seized it by the pommel, and endeavored to hold it firm,\r\nbut in vain; and had just time to save himself by clasping old Gunpowder\r\nround the neck, when the saddle fell to the earth, and he heard it\r\ntrampled under foot by his pursuer. For a moment the terror of Hans Van\r\nRipper's wrath passed across his mind,--for it was his Sunday saddle;\r\nbut this was no time for petty fears; the goblin was hard on his\r\nhaunches; and (unskilful rider that he was!) he had much ado to maintain\r\nhis seat; sometimes slipping on one side, sometimes on another, and\r\nsometimes jolted on the high ridge of his horse's backbone, with a\r\nviolence that he verily feared would cleave him asunder.\r\n\r\nAn opening in the trees now cheered him with the hopes that the church\r\nbridge was at hand. The wavering reflection of a silver star in the\r\nbosom of the brook told him that he was not mistaken. He saw the walls\r\nof the church dimly glaring under the trees beyond. He recollected the\r\nplace where Brom Bones's ghostly competitor had disappeared. \"If I can\r\nbut reach that bridge,\" thought Ichabod, \"I am safe.\" Just then he heard\r\nthe black steed panting and blowing close behind him; he even fancied\r\nthat he felt his hot breath. Another convulsive kick in the ribs, and\r\nold Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge; he thundered over the resounding\r\nplanks; he gained the opposite side; and now Ichabod cast a look behind\r\nto see if his pursuer should vanish, according to rule, in a flash of\r\nfire and brimstone. Just then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups,\r\nand in the very act of hurling his head at him. Ichabod endeavored to\r\ndodge the horrible missile, but too late. It encountered his cranium\r\nwith a tremendous crash,--he was tumbled headlong into the dust, and\r\nGunpowder, the black steed, and the goblin rider, passed by like a\r\nwhirlwind.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the old horse was found without his saddle, and with\r\nthe bridle under his feet, soberly cropping the grass at his master's\r\ngate. Ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast; dinner-hour\r\ncame, but no Ichabod. The boys assembled at the schoolhouse, and\r\nstrolled idly about the banks of the brook; but no schoolmaster. Hans\r\nVan Ripper now began to feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor\r\nIchabod, and his saddle. An inquiry was set on foot, and after diligent\r\ninvestigation they came upon his traces. In one part of the road leading\r\nto the church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt; the tracks of\r\nhorses' hoofs deeply dented in the road, and evidently at furious speed,\r\nwere traced to the bridge, beyond which, on the bank of a broad part of\r\nthe brook, where the water ran deep and black, was found the hat of the\r\nunfortunate Ichabod, and close beside it a shattered pumpkin.\r\n\r\nThe brook was searched, but the body of the schoolmaster was not to\r\nbe discovered. Hans Van Ripper as executor of his estate, examined the\r\nbundle which contained all his worldly effects. They consisted of two\r\nshirts and a half; two stocks for the neck; a pair or two of worsted\r\nstockings; an old pair of corduroy small-clothes; a rusty razor; a book\r\nof psalm tunes full of dog's-ears; and a broken pitch-pipe. As to the\r\nbooks and furniture of the schoolhouse, they belonged to the community,\r\nexcepting Cotton Mather's \"History of Witchcraft,\" a \"New England\r\nAlmanac,\" and a book of dreams and fortune-telling; in which last was\r\na sheet of foolscap much scribbled and blotted in several fruitless\r\nattempts to make a copy of verses in honor of the heiress of Van Tassel.\r\nThese magic books and the poetic scrawl were forthwith consigned to the\r\nflames by Hans Van Ripper; who, from that time forward, determined to\r\nsend his children no more to school, observing that he never knew\r\nany good come of this same reading and writing. Whatever money the\r\nschoolmaster possessed, and he had received his quarter's pay but a\r\nday or two before, he must have had about his person at the time of his\r\ndisappearance.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious event caused much speculation at the church on the\r\nfollowing Sunday. Knots of gazers and gossips were collected in the\r\nchurchyard, at the bridge, and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin\r\nhad been found. The stories of Brouwer, of Bones, and a whole budget of\r\nothers were called to mind; and when they had diligently considered them\r\nall, and compared them with the symptoms of the present case, they shook\r\ntheir heads, and came to the conclusion that Ichabod had been carried\r\noff by the Galloping Hessian. As he was a bachelor, and in nobody's\r\ndebt, nobody troubled his head any more about him; the school was\r\nremoved to a different quarter of the hollow, and another pedagogue\r\nreigned in his stead.\r\n\r\nIt is true, an old farmer, who had been down to New York on a visit\r\nseveral years after, and from whom this account of the ghostly adventure\r\nwas received, brought home the intelligence that Ichabod Crane was still\r\nalive; that he had left the neighborhood partly through fear of the\r\ngoblin and Hans Van Ripper, and partly in mortification at having been\r\nsuddenly dismissed by the heiress; that he had changed his quarters to a\r\ndistant part of the country; had kept school and studied law at the same\r\ntime; had been admitted to the bar; turned politician; electioneered;\r\nwritten for the newspapers; and finally had been made a justice of\r\nthe Ten Pound Court. Brom Bones, too, who, shortly after his rival's\r\ndisappearance conducted the blooming Katrina in triumph to the altar,\r\nwas observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod\r\nwas related, and always burst into a hearty laugh at the mention of the\r\npumpkin; which led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter\r\nthan he chose to tell.\r\n\r\nThe old country wives, however, who are the best judges of these\r\nmatters, maintain to this day that Ichabod was spirited away by\r\nsupernatural means; and it is a favorite story often told about the\r\nneighborhood round the winter evening fire. The bridge became more than\r\never an object of superstitious awe; and that may be the reason why the\r\nroad has been altered of late years, so as to approach the church by\r\nthe border of the millpond. The schoolhouse being deserted soon fell to\r\ndecay, and was reported to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate\r\npedagogue and the plowboy, loitering homeward of a still summer evening,\r\nhas often fancied his voice at a distance, chanting a melancholy psalm\r\ntune among the tranquil solitudes of Sleepy Hollow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nFOUND IN THE HANDWRITING OF MR. KNICKERBOCKER.\r\n\r\nThe preceding tale is given almost in the precise words in which I\r\nheard it related at a Corporation meeting at the ancient city of\r\nManhattoes, at which were present many of its sagest and most\r\nillustrious burghers. The narrator was a pleasant, shabby, gentlemanly\r\nold fellow, in pepper-and-salt clothes, with a sadly humourous face,\r\nand one whom I strongly suspected of being poor--he made such efforts\r\nto be entertaining. When his story was concluded, there was much\r\nlaughter and approbation, particularly from two or three deputy\r\naldermen, who had been asleep the greater part of the time. There was,\r\nhowever, one tall, dry-looking old gentleman, with beetling eyebrows,\r\nwho maintained a grave and rather severe face throughout, now and then\r\nfolding his arms, inclining his head, and looking down upon the floor,\r\nas if turning a doubt over in his mind. He was one of your wary men,\r\nwho never laugh but upon good grounds--when they have reason and law on\r\ntheir side. When the mirth of the rest of the company had subsided, and\r\nsilence was restored, he leaned one arm on the elbow of his chair, and\r\nsticking the other akimbo, demanded, with a slight, but exceedingly\r\nsage motion of the head, and contraction of the brow, what was the\r\nmoral of the story, and what it went to prove?\r\n\r\nThe story-teller, who was just putting a glass of wine to his lips, as\r\na refreshment after his toils, paused for a moment, looked at his\r\ninquirer with an air of infinite deference, and, lowering the glass\r\nslowly to the table, observed that the story was intended most\r\nlogically to prove--\r\n\r\n\"That there is no situation in life but has its advantages and\r\npleasures--provided we will but take a joke as we find it:\r\n\r\n\"That, therefore, he that runs races with goblin troopers is likely to\r\nhave rough riding of it.\r\n\r\n\"Ergo, for a country schoolmaster to be refused the hand of a Dutch\r\nheiress is a certain step to high preferment in the state.\"\r\n\r\nThe cautious old gentleman knit his brows tenfold closer after this\r\nexplanation, being sorely puzzled by the ratiocination of the\r\nsyllogism, while, methought, the one in pepper-and-salt eyed him with\r\nsomething of a triumphant leer. At length he observed that all this was\r\nvery well, but still he thought the story a little on the\r\nextravagant--there were one or two points on which he had his doubts.\r\n\r\n\"Faith, sir,\" replied the story-teller, \"as to that matter, I don't\r\nbelieve one-half of it myself.\"  D.

Nelson and Clara T. Nelson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARTLEBY, THE SCRIVENER.\r\n\r\nA STORY OF WALL-STREET.\r\n\r\nI am a rather elderly man.  The nature of my avocations for the last\r\nthirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what\r\nwould seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as\r\nyet nothing that I know of has ever been written:--I mean the\r\nlaw-copyists or scriveners.  I have known very many of them,\r\nprofessionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate divers\r\nhistories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental\r\nsouls might weep.  But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners\r\nfor a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the\r\nstrangest I ever saw or heard of.  While of other law-copyists I might\r\nwrite the complete life, of Bartleby nothing of that sort can be done.\r\nI believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography\r\nof this man.  It is an irreparable loss to literature.  Bartleby was one\r\nof those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the\r\noriginal sources, and in his case those are very small.  What my own\r\nastonished eyes saw of Bartleby, _that_ is all I know of him, except,\r\nindeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel.\r\n\r\nEre introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I\r\nmake some mention of myself, my _employees_, my business, my chambers,\r\nand general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable\r\nto an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nImprimis:  I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with\r\na profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best.  Hence,\r\nthough I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous, even\r\nto turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered\r\nto invade my peace.  I am one of those unambitious lawyers who never\r\naddresses a jury, or in any way draws down public applause; but in the\r\ncool tranquility of a snug retreat, do a snug business among rich men's\r\nbonds and mortgages and title-deeds.  All who know me, consider me an\r\neminently _safe_ man.  The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little\r\ngiven to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first\r\ngrand point to be prudence; my next, method.  I do not speak it in\r\nvanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my\r\nprofession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love\r\nto repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings\r\nlike unto bullion.  I will freely add, that I was not insensible to the\r\nlate John Jacob Astor's good opinion.\r\n\r\nSome time prior to the period at which this little history begins, my\r\navocations had been largely increased.  The good old office, now extinct\r\nin the State of New York, of a Master in Chancery, had been conferred\r\nupon me.  It was not a very arduous office, but very pleasantly\r\nremunerative.  I seldom lose my temper; much more seldom indulge in\r\ndangerous indignation at wrongs and outrages; but I must be permitted to\r\nbe rash here and declare, that I consider the sudden and violent\r\nabrogation of the office of Master in Chancery, by the new Constitution,\r\nas a--premature act; inasmuch as I had counted upon a life-lease of the\r\nprofits, whereas I only received those of a few short years.  But this\r\nis by the way.\r\n\r\nMy chambers were up stairs at No.--Wall-street.  At one end they looked\r\nupon the white wall of the interior of a spacious sky-light shaft,\r\npenetrating the building from top to bottom.  This view might have been\r\nconsidered rather tame than otherwise, deficient in what landscape\r\npainters call \"life.\"  But if so, the view from the other end of my\r\nchambers offered, at least, a contrast, if nothing more.  In that\r\ndirection my windows commanded an unobstructed view of a lofty brick\r\nwall, black by age and everlasting shade; which wall required no\r\nspy-glass to bring out its lurking beauties, but for the benefit of all\r\nnear-sighted spectators, was pushed up to within ten feet of my window\r\npanes.  Owing to the great height of the surrounding buildings, and my\r\nchambers being on the second floor, the interval between this wall and\r\nmine not a little resembled a huge square cistern.\r\n\r\nAt the period just preceding the advent of Bartleby, I had two persons\r\nas copyists in my employment, and a promising lad as an office-boy.\r\nFirst, Turkey; second, Nippers; third, Ginger Nut.  These may seem\r\nnames, the like of which are not usually found in the Directory.  In\r\ntruth they were nicknames, mutually conferred upon each other by my\r\nthree clerks, and were deemed expressive of their respective persons or\r\ncharacters.  Turkey was a short, pursy Englishman of about my own age,\r\nthat is, somewhere not far from sixty.  In the morning, one might say,\r\nhis face was of a fine florid hue, but after twelve o'clock,\r\nmeridian--his dinner hour--it blazed like a grate full of Christmas\r\ncoals; and continued blazing--but, as it were, with a gradual wane--till\r\n6 o'clock, P.M. or thereabouts, after which I saw no more of the\r\nproprietor of the face, which gaining its meridian with the sun, seemed\r\nto set with it, to rise, culminate, and decline the following day, with\r\nthe like regularity and undiminished glory.  There are many singular\r\ncoincidences I have known in the course of my life, not the least among\r\nwhich was the fact, that exactly when Turkey displayed his fullest beams\r\nfrom his red and radiant countenance, just then, too, at that critical\r\nmoment, began the daily period when I considered his business capacities\r\nas seriously disturbed for the remainder of the twenty-four hours.  Not\r\nthat he was absolutely idle, or averse to business then; far from it.\r\nThe difficulty was, he was apt to be altogether too energetic.  There\r\nwas a strange, inflamed, flurried, flighty recklessness of activity\r\nabout him.  He would be incautious in dipping his pen into his inkstand.\r\nAll his blots upon my documents, were dropped there after twelve\r\no'clock, meridian.  Indeed, not only would he be reckless and sadly\r\ngiven to making blots in the afternoon, but some days he went further,\r\nand was rather noisy.  At such times, too, his face flamed with\r\naugmented blazonry, as if cannel coal had been heaped on anthracite.  He\r\nmade an unpleasant racket with his chair; spilled his sand-box; in\r\nmending his pens, impatiently split them all to pieces, and threw them\r\non the floor in a sudden passion; stood up and leaned over his table,\r\nboxing his papers about in a most indecorous manner, very sad to behold\r\nin an elderly man like him.  Nevertheless, as he was in many ways a most\r\nvaluable person to me, and all the time before twelve o'clock, meridian,\r\nwas the quickest, steadiest creature too, accomplishing a great deal of\r\nwork in a style not easy to be matched--for these reasons, I was willing\r\nto overlook his eccentricities, though indeed, occasionally, I\r\nremonstrated with him.  I did this very gently, however, because, though\r\nthe civilest, nay, the blandest and most reverential of men in the\r\nmorning, yet in the afternoon he was disposed, upon provocation, to be\r\nslightly rash with his tongue, in fact, insolent.  Now, valuing his\r\nmorning services as I did, and resolved not to lose them; yet, at the\r\nsame time made uncomfortable by his inflamed ways after twelve o'clock;\r\nand being a man of peace, unwilling by my admonitions to call forth\r\nunseemly retorts from him; I took upon me, one Saturday noon (he was\r\nalways worse on Saturdays), to hint to him, very kindly, that perhaps\r\nnow that he was growing old, it might be well to abridge his labors; in\r\nshort, he need not come to my chambers after twelve o'clock, but, dinner\r\nover, had best go home to his lodgings and rest himself till teatime.\r\nBut no; he insisted upon his afternoon devotions.  His countenance\r\nbecame intolerably fervid, as he oratorically assured me--gesticulating\r\nwith a long ruler at the other end of the room--that if his services in\r\nthe morning were useful, how indispensable, then, in the afternoon?\r\n\r\n\"With submission, sir,\" said Turkey on this occasion, \"I consider myself\r\nyour right-hand man.  In the morning I but marshal and deploy my\r\ncolumns; but in the afternoon I put myself at their head, and gallantly\r\ncharge the foe, thus!\"--and he made a violent thrust with the ruler.\r\n\r\n\"But the blots, Turkey,\" intimated I.\r\n\r\n\"True,--but, with submission, sir, behold these hairs!  I am getting\r\nold.  Surely, sir, a blot or two of a warm afternoon is not to be\r\nseverely urged against gray hairs.  Old age--even if it blot the\r\npage--is honorable.  With submission, sir, we _both_ are getting old.\"\r\n\r\nThis appeal to my fellow-feeling was hardly to be resisted.  At all\r\nevents, I saw that go he would not.  So I made up my mind to let him\r\nstay, resolving, nevertheless, to see to it, that during the afternoon\r\nhe had to do with my less important papers.\r\n\r\nNippers, the second on my list, was a whiskered, sallow, and, upon the\r\nwhole, rather piratical-looking young man of about five and twenty.  I\r\nalways deemed him the victim of two evil powers--ambition and\r\nindigestion.  The ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the\r\nduties of a mere copyist, an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly\r\nprofessional affairs, such as the original drawing up of legal\r\ndocuments.  The indigestion seemed betokened in an occasional nervous\r\ntestiness and grinning irritability, causing the teeth to audibly grind\r\ntogether over mistakes committed in copying; unnecessary maledictions,\r\nhissed, rather than spoken, in the heat of business; and especially by a\r\ncontinual discontent with the height of the table where he worked.\r\nThough of a very ingenious mechanical turn, Nippers could never get this\r\ntable to suit him.  He put chips under it, blocks of various sorts, bits\r\nof pasteboard, and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite\r\nadjustment by final pieces of folded blotting paper.  But no invention\r\nwould answer.  If, for the sake of easing his back, he brought the table\r\nlid at a sharp angle well up towards his chin, and wrote there like a\r\nman using the steep roof of a Dutch house for his desk:--then he\r\ndeclared that it stopped the circulation in his arms.  If now he lowered\r\nthe table to his waistbands, and stooped over it in writing, then there\r\nwas a sore aching in his back.  In short, the truth of the matter was,\r\nNippers knew not what he wanted.  Or, if he wanted any thing, it was to\r\nbe rid of a scrivener's table altogether.  Among the manifestations of\r\nhis diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from\r\ncertain ambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats, whom he called his\r\nclients.  Indeed I was aware that not only was he, at times,\r\nconsiderable of a ward-politician, but he occasionally did a little\r\nbusiness at the Justices' courts, and was not unknown on the steps of\r\nthe Tombs.  I have good reason to believe, however, that one individual\r\nwho called upon him at my chambers, and who, with a grand air, he\r\ninsisted was his client, was no other than a dun, and the alleged\r\ntitle-deed, a bill.  But with all his failings, and the annoyances he\r\ncaused me, Nippers, like his compatriot Turkey, was a very useful man to\r\nme; wrote a neat, swift hand; and, when he chose, was not deficient in a\r\ngentlemanly sort of deportment.  Added to this, he always dressed in a\r\ngentlemanly sort of way; and so, incidentally, reflected credit upon my\r\nchambers.  Whereas with respect to Turkey, I had much ado to keep him\r\nfrom being a reproach to me.  His clothes were apt to look oily and\r\nsmell of eating-houses.  He wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy in\r\nsummer.  His coats were execrable; his hat not to be handled.  But while\r\nthe hat was a thing of indifference to me, inasmuch as his natural\r\ncivility and deference, as a dependent Englishman, always led him to\r\ndoff it the moment he entered the room, yet his coat was another matter.\r\nConcerning his coats, I reasoned with him; but with no effect.  The\r\ntruth was, I suppose, that a man of so small an income, could not afford\r\nto sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and the same\r\ntime.  As Nippers once observed, Turkey's money went chiefly for red\r\nink.  One winter day I presented Turkey with a highly-respectable\r\nlooking coat of my own, a padded gray coat, of a most comfortable\r\nwarmth, and which buttoned straight up from the knee to the neck.  I\r\nthought Turkey would appreciate the favor, and abate his rashness and\r\nobstreperousness of afternoons.  But no.  I verily believe that\r\nbuttoning himself up in so downy and blanket-like a coat had a\r\npernicious effect upon him; upon the same principle that too much oats\r\nare bad for horses.  In fact, precisely as a rash, restive horse is said\r\nto feel his oats, so Turkey felt his coat.  It made him insolent.  He\r\nwas a man whom prosperity harmed.\r\n\r\nThough concerning the self-indulgent habits of Turkey I had my own\r\nprivate surmises, yet touching Nippers I was well persuaded that\r\nwhatever might be his faults in other respects, he was, at least, a\r\ntemperate young man.  But indeed, nature herself seemed to have been his\r\nvintner, and at his birth charged him so thoroughly with an irritable,\r\nbrandy-like disposition, that all subsequent potations were needless.\r\nWhen I consider how, amid the stillness of my chambers, Nippers would\r\nsometimes impatiently rise from his seat, and stooping over his table,\r\nspread his arms wide apart, seize the whole desk, and move it, and jerk\r\nit, with a grim, grinding motion on the floor, as if the table were a\r\nperverse voluntary agent, intent on thwarting and vexing him; I plainly\r\nperceive that for Nippers, brandy and water were altogether superfluous.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for me that, owing to its peculiar\r\ncause--indigestion--the irritability and consequent nervousness of\r\nNippers, were mainly observable in the morning, while in the afternoon\r\nhe was comparatively mild.  So that Turkey's paroxysms only coming on\r\nabout twelve o'clock, I never had to do with their eccentricities at one\r\ntime.  Their fits relieved each other like guards.  When Nippers' was\r\non, Turkey's was off; and _vice versa_.  This was a good natural\r\narrangement under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nGinger Nut, the third on my list, was a lad some twelve years old.  His\r\nfather was a carman, ambitious of seeing his son on the bench instead of\r\na cart, before he died.  So he sent him to my office as student at law,\r\nerrand boy, and cleaner and sweeper, at the rate of one dollar a week.\r\nHe had a little desk to himself, but he did not use it much.  Upon\r\ninspection, the drawer exhibited a great array of the shells of various\r\nsorts of nuts.  Indeed, to this quick-witted youth the whole noble\r\nscience of the law was contained in a nut-shell.  Not the least among\r\nthe employments of Ginger Nut, as well as one which he discharged with\r\nthe most alacrity, was his duty as cake and apple purveyor for Turkey\r\nand Nippers.  Copying law papers being proverbially dry, husky sort of\r\nbusiness, my two scriveners were fain to moisten their mouths very often\r\nwith Spitzenbergs to be had at the numerous stalls nigh the Custom\r\nHouse and Post Office.  Also, they sent Ginger Nut very frequently for\r\nthat peculiar cake--small, flat, round, and very spicy--after which he\r\nhad been named by them.  Of a cold morning when business was but dull,\r\nTurkey would gobble up scores of these cakes, as if they were mere\r\nwafers--indeed they sell them at the rate of six or eight for a\r\npenny--the scrape of his pen blending with the crunching of the crisp\r\nparticles in his mouth.  Of all the fiery afternoon blunders and\r\nflurried rashnesses of Turkey, was his once moistening a ginger-cake\r\nbetween his lips, and clapping it on to a mortgage for a seal.  I came\r\nwithin an ace of dismissing him then.  But he mollified me by making an\r\noriental bow, and saying--\"With submission, sir, it was generous of me\r\nto find you in stationery on my own account.\"\r\n\r\nNow my original business--that of a conveyancer and title hunter, and\r\ndrawer-up of recondite documents of all sorts--was considerably\r\nincreased by receiving the master's office.  There was now great work\r\nfor scriveners.  Not only must I push the clerks already with me, but I\r\nmust have additional help.  In answer to my advertisement, a motionless\r\nyoung man one morning, stood upon my office threshold, the door being\r\nopen, for it was summer.  I can see that figure now--pallidly neat,\r\npitiably respectable, incurably forlorn!  It was Bartleby.\r\n\r\nAfter a few words touching his qualifications, I engaged him, glad to\r\nhave among my corps of copyists a man of so singularly sedate an aspect,\r\nwhich I thought might operate beneficially upon the flighty temper of\r\nTurkey, and the fiery one of Nippers.\r\n\r\nI should have stated before that ground glass folding-doors divided my\r\npremises into two parts, one of which was occupied by my scriveners, the\r\nother by myself.  According to my humor I threw open these doors, or\r\nclosed them.  I resolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the\r\nfolding-doors, but on my side of them, so as to have this quiet man\r\nwithin easy call, in case any trifling thing was to be done.  I placed\r\nhis desk close up to a small side-window in that part of the room, a\r\nwindow which originally had afforded a lateral view of certain grimy\r\nback-yards and bricks, but which, owing to subsequent erections,\r\ncommanded at present no view at all, though it gave some light.  Within\r\nthree feet of the panes was a wall, and the light came down from far\r\nabove, between two lofty buildings, as from a very small opening in a\r\ndome.  Still further to a satisfactory arrangement, I procured a high\r\ngreen folding screen, which might entirely isolate Bartleby from my\r\nsight, though not remove him from my voice.  And thus, in a manner,\r\nprivacy and society were conjoined.\r\n\r\nAt first Bartleby did an extraordinary quantity of writing.  As if long\r\nfamishing for something to copy, he seemed to gorge himself on my\r\ndocuments.  There was no pause for digestion.  He ran a day and night\r\nline, copying by sun-light and by candle-light.  I should have been\r\nquite delighted with his application, had he been cheerfully\r\nindustrious.  But he wrote on silently, palely, mechanically.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, an indispensable part of a scrivener's business to\r\nverify the accuracy of his copy, word by word.  Where there are two or\r\nmore scriveners in an office, they assist each other in this\r\nexamination, one reading from the copy, the other holding the original.\r\nIt is a very dull, wearisome, and lethargic affair.  I can readily\r\nimagine that to some sanguine temperaments it would be altogether\r\nintolerable.  For example, I cannot credit that the mettlesome poet\r\nByron would have contentedly sat down with Bartleby to examine a law\r\ndocument of, say five hundred pages, closely written in a crimpy hand.\r\n\r\nNow and then, in the haste of business, it had been my habit to assist\r\nin comparing some brief document myself, calling Turkey or Nippers for\r\nthis purpose.  One object I had in placing Bartleby so handy to me\r\nbehind the screen, was to avail myself of his services on such trivial\r\noccasions.  It was on the third day, I think, of his being with me, and\r\nbefore any necessity had arisen for having his own writing examined,\r\nthat, being much hurried to complete a small affair I had in hand, I\r\nabruptly called to Bartleby.  In my haste and natural expectancy of\r\ninstant compliance, I sat with my head bent over the original on my\r\ndesk, and my right hand sideways, and somewhat nervously extended with\r\nthe copy, so that immediately upon emerging from his retreat, Bartleby\r\nmight snatch it and proceed to business without the least delay.\r\n\r\nIn this very attitude did I sit when I called to him, rapidly stating\r\nwhat it was I wanted him to do--namely, to examine a small paper with\r\nme.  Imagine my surprise, nay, my consternation, when without moving\r\nfrom his privacy, Bartleby in a singularly mild, firm voice, replied, \"I\r\nwould prefer not to.\"\r\n\r\nI sat awhile in perfect silence, rallying my stunned faculties.\r\nImmediately it occurred to me that my ears had deceived me, or Bartleby\r\nhad entirely misunderstood my meaning.  I repeated my request in the\r\nclearest tone I could assume.  But in quite as clear a one came the\r\nprevious reply, \"I would prefer not to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prefer not to,\" echoed I, rising in high excitement, and crossing the\r\nroom with a stride.  \"What do you mean?  Are you moon-struck?  I want\r\nyou to help me compare this sheet here--take it,\" and I thrust it\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer not to,\" said he.\r\n\r\nI looked at him steadfastly.  His face was leanly composed; his gray eye\r\ndimly calm.  Not a wrinkle of agitation rippled him.  Had there been the\r\nleast uneasiness, anger, impatience or impertinence in his manner; in\r\nother words, had there been any thing ordinarily human about him,\r\ndoubtless I should have violently dismissed him from the premises.  But\r\nas it was, I should have as soon thought of turning my pale\r\nplaster-of-paris bust of Cicero out of doors.  I stood gazing at him\r\nawhile, as he went on with his own writing, and then reseated myself at\r\nmy desk.  This is very strange, thought I.  What had one best do?  But\r\nmy business hurried me.  I concluded to forget the matter for the\r\npresent, reserving it for my future leisure.  So calling Nippers from\r\nthe other room, the paper was speedily examined.\r\n\r\nA few days after this, Bartleby concluded four lengthy documents, being\r\nquadruplicates of a week's testimony taken before me in my High Court of\r\nChancery.  It became necessary to examine them.  It was an important\r\nsuit, and great accuracy was imperative.  Having all things arranged I\r\ncalled Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut from the next room, meaning to\r\nplace the four copies in the hands of my four clerks, while I should\r\nread from the original.  Accordingly Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut had\r\ntaken their seats in a row, each with his document in hand, when I\r\ncalled to Bartleby to join this interesting group.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby!  quick, I am waiting.\"\r\n\r\nI heard a slow scrape of his chair legs on the uncarpeted floor, and\r\nsoon he appeared standing at the entrance of his hermitage.\r\n\r\n\"What is wanted?\" said he mildly.\r\n\r\n\"The copies, the copies,\" said I hurriedly.  \"We are going to examine\r\nthem.  There\"--and I held towards him the fourth quadruplicate.\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer not to,\" he said, and gently disappeared behind the\r\nscreen.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments I was turned into a pillar of salt, standing at the\r\nhead of my seated column of clerks.  Recovering myself, I advanced\r\ntowards the screen, and demanded the reason for such extraordinary\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n\"_Why_ do you refuse?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer not to.\"\r\n\r\nWith any other man I should have flown outright into a dreadful passion,\r\nscorned all further words, and thrust him ignominiously from my\r\npresence.  But there was something about Bartleby that not only\r\nstrangely disarmed me, but in a wonderful manner touched and\r\ndisconcerted me.  I began to reason with him.\r\n\r\n\"These are your own copies we are about to examine.  It is labor saving\r\nto you, because one examination will answer for your four papers.  It is\r\ncommon usage.  Every copyist is bound to help examine his copy.  Is it\r\nnot so?  Will you not speak?  Answer!\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer not to,\" he replied in a flute-like tone.  It seemed to me\r\nthat while I had been addressing him, he carefully revolved every\r\nstatement that I made; fully comprehended the meaning; could not gainsay\r\nthe irresistible conclusions; but, at the same time, some paramount\r\nconsideration prevailed with him to reply as he did.\r\n\r\n\"You are decided, then, not to comply with my request--a request made\r\naccording to common usage and common sense?\"\r\n\r\nHe briefly gave me to understand that on that point my judgment was\r\nsound.  Yes:  his decision was irreversible.\r\n\r\nIt is not seldom the case that when a man is browbeaten in some\r\nunprecedented and violently unreasonable way, he begins to stagger in\r\nhis own plainest faith.  He begins, as it were, vaguely to surmise that,\r\nwonderful as it may be, all the justice and all the reason is on the\r\nother side.  Accordingly, if any disinterested persons are present, he\r\nturns to them for some reinforcement for his own faltering mind.\r\n\r\n\"Turkey,\" said I, \"what do you think of this?  Am I not right?\"\r\n\r\n\"With submission, sir,\" said Turkey, with his blandest tone, \"I think\r\nthat you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nippers,\" said I, \"what do _you_ think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I should kick him out of the office.\"\r\n\r\n(The reader of nice perceptions will here perceive that, it being\r\nmorning, Turkey's answer is couched in polite and tranquil terms, but\r\nNippers replies in ill-tempered ones.  Or, to repeat a previous\r\nsentence, Nippers' ugly mood was on duty and Turkey's off.)\r\n\r\n\"Ginger Nut,\" said I, willing to enlist the smallest suffrage in my\r\nbehalf, \"what do you think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, sir, he's a little _luny_,\" replied Ginger Nut with a grin.\r\n\r\n\"You hear what they say,\" said I, turning towards the screen, \"come\r\nforth and do your duty.\"\r\n\r\nBut he vouchsafed no reply.  I pondered a moment in sore perplexity.\r\nBut once more business hurried me.  I determined again to postpone the\r\nconsideration of this dilemma to my future leisure.  With a little\r\ntrouble we made out to examine the papers without Bartleby, though at\r\nevery page or two, Turkey deferentially dropped his opinion that this\r\nproceeding was quite out of the common; while Nippers, twitching in his\r\nchair with a dyspeptic nervousness, ground out between his set teeth\r\noccasional hissing maledictions against the stubborn oaf behind the\r\nscreen.  And for his (Nippers') part, this was the first and the last\r\ntime he would do another man's business without pay.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bartleby sat in his hermitage, oblivious to every thing but\r\nhis own peculiar business there.\r\n\r\nSome days passed, the scrivener being employed upon another lengthy\r\nwork.  His late remarkable conduct led me to regard his ways narrowly.\r\nI observed that he never went to dinner; indeed that he never went any\r\nwhere.  As yet I had never of my personal knowledge known him to be\r\noutside of my office.  He was a perpetual sentry in the corner.  At\r\nabout eleven o'clock though, in the morning, I noticed that Ginger Nut\r\nwould advance toward the opening in Bartleby's screen, as if silently\r\nbeckoned thither by a gesture invisible to me where I sat.  The boy\r\nwould then leave the office jingling a few pence, and reappear with a\r\nhandful of ginger-nuts which he delivered in the hermitage, receiving\r\ntwo of the cakes for his trouble.\r\n\r\nHe lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I; never eats a dinner, properly\r\nspeaking; he must be a vegetarian then; but no; he never eats even\r\nvegetables, he eats nothing but ginger-nuts.  My mind then ran on in\r\nreveries concerning the probable effects upon the human constitution of\r\nliving entirely on ginger-nuts.  Ginger-nuts are so called because they\r\ncontain ginger as one of their peculiar constituents, and the final\r\nflavoring one.  Now what was ginger?  A hot, spicy thing.  Was Bartleby\r\nhot and spicy?  Not at all.  Ginger, then, had no effect upon Bartleby.\r\nProbably he preferred it should have none.\r\n\r\nNothing so aggravates an earnest person as a passive resistance.  If the\r\nindividual so resisted be of a not inhumane temper, and the resisting\r\none perfectly harmless in his passivity; then, in the better moods of\r\nthe former, he will endeavor charitably to construe to his imagination\r\nwhat proves impossible to be solved by his judgment.  Even so, for the\r\nmost part, I regarded Bartleby and his ways.  Poor fellow! thought I, he\r\nmeans no mischief; it is plain he intends no insolence; his aspect\r\nsufficiently evinces that his eccentricities are involuntary.  He is\r\nuseful to me.  I can get along with him.  If I turn him away, the\r\nchances are he will fall in with some less indulgent employer, and then\r\nhe will be rudely treated, and perhaps driven forth miserably to starve.\r\nYes.  Here I can cheaply purchase a delicious self-approval.  To\r\nbefriend Bartleby; to humor him in his strange willfulness, will cost me\r\nlittle or nothing, while I lay up in my soul what will eventually prove\r\na sweet morsel for my conscience.  But this mood was not invariable with\r\nme.  The passiveness of Bartleby sometimes irritated me.  I felt\r\nstrangely goaded on to encounter him in new opposition, to elicit some\r\nangry spark from him answerable to my own.  But indeed I might as well\r\nhave essayed to strike fire with my knuckles against a bit of Windsor\r\nsoap.  But one afternoon the evil impulse in me mastered me, and the\r\nfollowing little scene ensued:\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" said I, \"when those papers are all copied, I will compare\r\nthem with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer not to.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?  Surely you do not mean to persist in that mulish vagary?\"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nI threw open the folding-doors near by, and turning upon Turkey and\r\nNippers, exclaimed in an excited manner--\r\n\r\n\"He says, a second time, he won't examine his papers.  What do you think\r\nof it, Turkey?\"\r\n\r\nIt was afternoon, be it remembered.  Turkey sat glowing like a brass\r\nboiler, his bald head steaming, his hands reeling among his blotted\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n\"Think of it?\" roared Turkey; \"I think I'll just step behind his screen,\r\nand black his eyes for him!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Turkey rose to his feet and threw his arms into a pugilistic\r\nposition.  He was hurrying away to make good his promise, when I\r\ndetained him, alarmed at the effect of incautiously rousing Turkey's\r\ncombativeness after dinner.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Turkey,\" said I, \"and hear what Nippers has to say.  What do\r\nyou think of it, Nippers?  Would I not be justified in immediately\r\ndismissing Bartleby?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, that is for you to decide, sir.  I think his conduct quite\r\nunusual, and indeed unjust, as regards Turkey and myself.  But it may\r\nonly be a passing whim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" exclaimed I, \"you have strangely changed your mind then--you speak\r\nvery gently of him now.\"\r\n\r\n\"All beer,\" cried Turkey; \"gentleness is effects of beer--Nippers and I\r\ndined together to-day.  You see how gentle _I_ am, sir.  Shall I go and\r\nblack his eyes?\"\r\n\r\n\"You refer to Bartleby, I suppose.  No, not to-day, Turkey,\" I replied;\r\n\"pray, put up your fists.\"\r\n\r\nI closed the doors, and again advanced towards Bartleby.  I felt\r\nadditional incentives tempting me to my fate.  I burned to be rebelled\r\nagainst again.  I remembered that Bartleby never left the office.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" said I, \"Ginger Nut is away; just step round to the Post\r\nOffice, won't you? (it was but a three minute walk,) and see if there is\r\nany thing for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer not to.\"\r\n\r\n\"You _will_ not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I _prefer_ not.\"\r\n\r\nI staggered to my desk, and sat there in a deep study.  My blind\r\ninveteracy returned.  Was there any other thing in which I could procure\r\nmyself to be ignominiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?--my\r\nhired clerk?  What added thing is there, perfectly reasonable, that he\r\nwill be sure to refuse to do?\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby!\"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" in a louder tone.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" I roared.\r\n\r\nLike a very ghost, agreeably to the laws of magical invocation, at the\r\nthird summons, he appeared at the entrance of his hermitage.\r\n\r\n\"Go to the next room, and tell Nippers to come to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer not to,\" he respectfully and slowly said, and mildly\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Bartleby,\" said I, in a quiet sort of serenely severe\r\nself-possessed tone, intimating the unalterable purpose of some terrible\r\nretribution very close at hand.  At the moment I half intended something\r\nof the kind.  But upon the whole, as it was drawing towards my\r\ndinner-hour, I thought it best to put on my hat and walk home for the\r\nday, suffering much from perplexity and distress of mind.\r\n\r\nShall I acknowledge it?  The conclusion of this whole business was, that\r\nit soon became a fixed fact of my chambers, that a pale young scrivener,\r\nby the name of Bartleby, and a desk there; that he copied for me at the\r\nusual rate of four cents a folio (one hundred words); but he was\r\npermanently exempt from examining the work done by him, that duty being\r\ntransferred to Turkey and Nippers, one of compliment doubtless to their\r\nsuperior acuteness; moreover, said Bartleby was never on any account to\r\nbe dispatched on the most trivial errand of any sort; and that even if\r\nentreated to take upon him such a matter, it was generally understood\r\nthat he would prefer not to--in other words, that he would refuse\r\npointblank.\r\n\r\nAs days passed on, I became considerably reconciled to Bartleby.  His\r\nsteadiness, his freedom from all dissipation, his incessant industry\r\n(except when he chose to throw himself into a standing revery behind his\r\nscreen), his great stillness, his unalterableness of demeanor under all\r\ncircumstances, made him a valuable acquisition.  One prime thing was\r\nthis,--_he was always there;_--first in the morning, continually\r\nthrough the day, and the last at night.  I had a singular confidence in\r\nhis honesty.  I felt my most precious papers perfectly safe in his\r\nhands.  Sometimes to be sure I could not, for the very soul of me, avoid\r\nfalling into sudden spasmodic passions with him.  For it was exceeding\r\ndifficult to bear in mind all the time those strange peculiarities,\r\nprivileges, and unheard of exemptions, forming the tacit stipulations on\r\nBartleby's part under which he remained in my office.  Now and then, in\r\nthe eagerness of dispatching pressing business, I would inadvertently\r\nsummon Bartleby, in a short, rapid tone, to put his finger, say, on the\r\nincipient tie of a bit of red tape with which I was about compressing\r\nsome papers.  Of course, from behind the screen the usual answer, \"I\r\nprefer not to,\" was sure to come; and then, how could a human creature\r\nwith the common infirmities of our nature, refrain from bitterly\r\nexclaiming upon such perverseness--such unreasonableness.  However,\r\nevery added repulse of this sort which I received only tended to lessen\r\nthe probability of my repeating the inadvertence.\r\n\r\nHere it must be said, that according to the custom of most legal\r\ngentlemen occupying chambers in densely-populated law buildings, there\r\nwere several keys to my door.  One was kept by a woman residing in the\r\nattic, which person weekly scrubbed and daily swept and dusted my\r\napartments.  Another was kept by Turkey for convenience sake.  The third\r\nI sometimes carried in my own pocket.  The fourth I knew not who had.\r\n\r\nNow, one Sunday morning I happened to go to Trinity Church, to hear a\r\ncelebrated preacher, and finding myself rather early on the ground, I\r\nthought I would walk around to my chambers for a while.  Luckily I had\r\nmy key with me; but upon applying it to the lock, I found it resisted by\r\nsomething inserted from the inside.  Quite surprised, I called out; when\r\nto my consternation a key was turned from within; and thrusting his lean\r\nvisage at me, and holding the door ajar, the apparition of Bartleby\r\nappeared, in his shirt sleeves, and otherwise in a strangely tattered\r\ndishabille, saying quietly that he was sorry, but he was deeply engaged\r\njust then, and--preferred not admitting me at present.  In a brief word\r\nor two, he moreover added, that perhaps I had better walk round the\r\nblock two or three times, and by that time he would probably have\r\nconcluded his affairs.\r\n\r\nNow, the utterly unsurmised appearance of Bartleby, tenanting my\r\nlaw-chambers of a Sunday morning, with his cadaverously gentlemanly\r\n_nonchalance_, yet withal firm and self-possessed, had such a strange\r\neffect upon me, that incontinently I slunk away from my own door, and\r\ndid as desired.  But not without sundry twinges of impotent rebellion\r\nagainst the mild effrontery of this unaccountable scrivener.  Indeed, it\r\nwas his wonderful mildness chiefly, which not only disarmed me, but\r\nunmanned me, as it were.  For I consider that one, for the time, is a\r\nsort of unmanned when he tranquilly permits his hired clerk to dictate\r\nto him, and order him away from his own premises.  Furthermore, I was\r\nfull of uneasiness as to what Bartleby could possibly be doing in my\r\noffice in his shirt sleeves, and in an otherwise dismantled condition of\r\na Sunday morning.  Was any thing amiss going on?  Nay, that was out of\r\nthe question.  It was not to be thought of for a moment that Bartleby\r\nwas an immoral person.  But what could he be doing there?--copying?  Nay\r\nagain, whatever might be his eccentricities, Bartleby was an eminently\r\ndecorous person.  He would be the last man to sit down to his desk in\r\nany state approaching to nudity.  Besides, it was Sunday; and there was\r\nsomething about Bartleby that forbade the supposition that he would by\r\nany secular occupation violate the proprieties of the day.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, my mind was not pacified; and full of a restless\r\ncuriosity, at last I returned to the door.  Without hindrance I inserted\r\nmy key, opened it, and entered.  Bartleby was not to be seen.  I looked\r\nround anxiously, peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that he\r\nwas gone.  Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for an\r\nindefinite period Bartleby must have ate, dressed, and slept in my\r\noffice, and that too without plate, mirror, or bed.  The cushioned seat\r\nof a rickety old sofa in one corner bore the faint impress of a lean,\r\nreclining form.  Rolled away under his desk, I found a blanket; under\r\nthe empty grate, a blacking box and brush; on a chair, a tin basin, with\r\nsoap and a ragged towel; in a newspaper a few crumbs of ginger-nuts and\r\na morsel of cheese.  Yes, thought I, it is evident enough that Bartleby\r\nhas been making his home here, keeping bachelor's hall all by himself.\r\nImmediately then the thought came sweeping across me, What miserable\r\nfriendlessness and loneliness are here revealed!  His poverty is great;\r\nbut his solitude, how horrible!  Think of it.  Of a Sunday, Wall-street\r\nis deserted as Petra; and every night of every day it is an emptiness.\r\nThis building too, which of week-days hums with industry and life, at\r\nnightfall echoes with sheer vacancy, and all through Sunday is forlorn.\r\nAnd here Bartleby makes his home; sole spectator of a solitude which he\r\nhas seen all populous--a sort of innocent and transformed Marius\r\nbrooding among the ruins of Carthage!\r\n\r\nFor the first time in my life a feeling of overpowering stinging\r\nmelancholy seized me.  Before, I had never experienced aught but a\r\nnot-unpleasing sadness.  The bond of a common humanity now drew me\r\nirresistibly to gloom.  A fraternal melancholy!  For both I and Bartleby\r\nwere sons of Adam.  I remembered the bright silks and sparkling faces I\r\nhad seen that day, in gala trim, swan-like sailing down the Mississippi\r\nof Broadway; and I contrasted them with the pallid copyist, and thought\r\nto myself, Ah, happiness courts the light, so we deem the world is gay;\r\nbut misery hides aloof, so we deem that misery there is none.  These sad\r\nfancyings--chimeras, doubtless, of a sick and silly brain--led on to\r\nother and more special thoughts, concerning the eccentricities of\r\nBartleby.  Presentiments of strange discoveries hovered round me.  The\r\nscrivener's pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring strangers,\r\nin its shivering winding sheet.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I was attracted by Bartleby's closed desk, the key in open\r\nsight left in the lock.\r\n\r\nI mean no mischief, seek the gratification of no heartless curiosity,\r\nthought I; besides, the desk is mine, and its contents too, so I will\r\nmake bold to look within.  Every thing was methodically arranged, the\r\npapers smoothly placed.  The pigeon holes were deep, and removing the\r\nfiles of documents, I groped into their recesses.  Presently I felt\r\nsomething there, and dragged it out.  It was an old bandanna\r\nhandkerchief, heavy and knotted.  I opened it, and saw it was a savings'\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nI now recalled all the quiet mysteries which I had noted in the man.  I\r\nremembered that he never spoke but to answer; that though at intervals\r\nhe had considerable time to himself, yet I had never seen him\r\nreading--no, not even a newspaper; that for long periods he would stand\r\nlooking out, at his pale window behind the screen, upon the dead brick\r\nwall; I was quite sure he never visited any refectory or eating house;\r\nwhile his pale face clearly indicated that he never drank beer like\r\nTurkey, or tea and coffee even, like other men; that he never went any\r\nwhere in particular that I could learn; never went out for a walk,\r\nunless indeed that was the case at present; that he had declined telling\r\nwho he was, or whence he came, or whether he had any relatives in the\r\nworld; that though so thin and pale, he never complained of ill health.\r\nAnd more than all, I remembered a certain unconscious air of pallid--how\r\nshall I call it?--of pallid haughtiness, say, or rather an austere\r\nreserve about him, which had positively awed me into my tame compliance\r\nwith his eccentricities, when I had feared to ask him to do the\r\nslightest incidental thing for me, even though I might know, from his\r\nlong-continued motionlessness, that behind his screen he must be\r\nstanding in one of those dead-wall reveries of his.\r\n\r\nRevolving all these things, and coupling them with the recently\r\ndiscovered fact that he made my office his constant abiding place and\r\nhome, and not forgetful of his morbid moodiness; revolving all these\r\nthings, a prudential feeling began to steal over me.  My first emotions\r\nhad been those of pure melancholy and sincerest pity; but just in\r\nproportion as the forlornness of Bartleby grew and grew to my\r\nimagination, did that same melancholy merge into fear, that pity into\r\nrepulsion.  So true it is, and so terrible too, that up to a certain\r\npoint the thought or sight of misery enlists our best affections; but,\r\nin certain special cases, beyond that point it does not.  They err who\r\nwould assert that invariably this is owing to the inherent selfishness\r\nof the human heart.  It rather proceeds from a certain hopelessness of\r\nremedying excessive and organic ill.  To a sensitive being, pity is not\r\nseldom pain.  And when at last it is perceived that such pity cannot\r\nlead to effectual succor, common sense bids the soul rid of it.  What I\r\nsaw that morning persuaded me that the scrivener was the victim of\r\ninnate and incurable disorder.  I might give alms to his body; but his\r\nbody did not pain him; it was his soul that suffered, and his soul I\r\ncould not reach.\r\n\r\nI did not accomplish the purpose of going to Trinity Church that\r\nmorning.  Somehow, the things I had seen disqualified me for the time\r\nfrom church-going.  I walked homeward, thinking what I would do with\r\nBartleby.  Finally, I resolved upon this;--I would put certain calm\r\nquestions to him the next morning, touching his history, etc., and if he\r\ndeclined to answer them openly and unreservedly (and I supposed he would\r\nprefer not), then to give him a twenty dollar bill over and above\r\nwhatever I might owe him, and tell him his services were no longer\r\nrequired; but that if in any other way I could assist him, I would be\r\nhappy to do so, especially if he desired to return to his native place,\r\nwherever that might be, I would willingly help to defray the expenses.\r\nMoreover, if, after reaching home, he found himself at any time in want\r\nof aid, a letter from him would be sure of a reply.\r\n\r\nThe next morning came.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" said I, gently calling to him behind his screen.\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" said I, in a still gentler tone, \"come here; I am not going\r\nto ask you to do any thing you would prefer not to do--I simply wish to\r\nspeak to you.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this he noiselessly slid into view.\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell me, Bartleby, where you were born?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer not to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell me _any thing_ about yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer not to.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what reasonable objection can you have to speak to me?  I feel\r\nfriendly towards you.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not look at me while I spoke, but kept his glance fixed upon my\r\nbust of Cicero, which as I then sat, was directly behind me, some six\r\ninches above my head.\r\n\r\n\"What is your answer, Bartleby?\" said I, after waiting a considerable\r\ntime for a reply, during which his countenance remained immovable, only\r\nthere was the faintest conceivable tremor of the white attenuated mouth.\r\n\r\n\"At present I prefer to give no answer,\" he said, and retired into his\r\nhermitage.\r\n\r\nIt was rather weak in me I confess, but his manner on this occasion\r\nnettled me.  Not only did there seem to lurk in it a certain calm\r\ndisdain, but his perverseness seemed ungrateful, considering the\r\nundeniable good usage and indulgence he had received from me.\r\n\r\nAgain I sat ruminating what I should do.  Mortified as I was at his\r\nbehavior, and resolved as I had been to dismiss him when I entered my\r\noffices, nevertheless I strangely felt something superstitious knocking\r\nat my heart, and forbidding me to carry out my purpose, and denouncing\r\nme for a villain if I dared to breathe one bitter word against this\r\nforlornest of mankind.  At last, familiarly drawing my chair behind his\r\nscreen, I sat down and said: \"Bartleby, never mind then about revealing\r\nyour history; but let me entreat you, as a friend, to comply as far as\r\nmay be with the usages of this office.  Say now you will help to examine\r\npapers to-morrow or next day: in short, say now that in a day or two you\r\nwill begin to be a little reasonable:--say so, Bartleby.\"\r\n\r\n\"At present I would prefer not to be a little reasonable,\" was his\r\nmildly cadaverous reply.\r\n\r\nJust then the folding-doors opened, and Nippers approached.  He seemed\r\nsuffering from an unusually bad night's rest, induced by severer\r\nindigestion than common.  He overheard those final words of Bartleby.\r\n\r\n\"_Prefer not_, eh?\" gritted Nippers--\"I'd _prefer_ him, if I were you,\r\nsir,\" addressing me--\"I'd _prefer_ him; I'd give him preferences, the\r\nstubborn mule!  What is it, sir, pray, that he _prefers_ not to do now?\"\r\n\r\nBartleby moved not a limb.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Nippers,\" said I, \"I'd prefer that you would withdraw for the\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\nSomehow, of late I had got into the way of involuntarily using this word\r\n\"prefer\" upon all sorts of not exactly suitable occasions.  And I\r\ntrembled to think that my contact with the scrivener had already and\r\nseriously affected me in a mental way.  And what further and deeper\r\naberration might it not yet produce?  This apprehension had not been\r\nwithout efficacy in determining me to summary means.\r\n\r\nAs Nippers, looking very sour and sulky, was departing, Turkey blandly\r\nand deferentially approached.\r\n\r\n\"With submission, sir,\" said he, \"yesterday I was thinking about\r\nBartleby here, and I think that if he would but prefer to take a quart\r\nof good ale every day, it would do much towards mending him, and\r\nenabling him to assist in examining his papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you have got the word too,\" said I, slightly excited.\r\n\r\n\"With submission, what word, sir,\" asked Turkey, respectfully crowding\r\nhimself into the contracted space behind the screen, and by so doing,\r\nmaking me jostle the scrivener.  \"What word, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer to be left alone here,\" said Bartleby, as if offended at\r\nbeing mobbed in his privacy.\r\n\r\n\"_That's_ the word, Turkey,\" said I--\"that's it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _prefer_? oh yes--queer word.  I never use it myself.  But, sir, as\r\nI was saying, if he would but prefer--\"\r\n\r\n\"Turkey,\" interrupted I, \"you will please withdraw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh certainly, sir, if you prefer that I should.\"\r\n\r\nAs he opened the folding-door to retire, Nippers at his desk caught a\r\nglimpse of me, and asked whether I would prefer to have a certain paper\r\ncopied on blue paper or white.  He did not in the least roguishly accent\r\nthe word prefer.  It was plain that it involuntarily rolled from his\r\ntongue.  I thought to myself, surely I must get rid of a demented man,\r\nwho already has in some degree turned the tongues, if not the heads of\r\nmyself and clerks.  But I thought it prudent not to break the dismission\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nThe next day I noticed that Bartleby did nothing but stand at his window\r\nin his dead-wall revery.  Upon asking him why he did not write, he said\r\nthat he had decided upon doing no more writing.\r\n\r\n\"Why, how now? what next?\" exclaimed I, \"do no more writing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No more.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is the reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not see the reason for yourself,\" he indifferently replied.\r\n\r\nI looked steadfastly at him, and perceived that his eyes looked dull and\r\nglazed.  Instantly it occurred to me, that his unexampled diligence in\r\ncopying by his dim window for the first few weeks of his stay with me\r\nmight have temporarily impaired his vision.\r\n\r\nI was touched.  I said something in condolence with him.  I hinted that\r\nof course he did wisely in abstaining from writing for a while; and\r\nurged him to embrace that opportunity of taking wholesome exercise in\r\nthe open air.  This, however, he did not do.  A few days after this, my\r\nother clerks being absent, and being in a great hurry to dispatch\r\ncertain letters by the mail, I thought that, having nothing else earthly\r\nto do, Bartleby would surely be less inflexible than usual, and carry\r\nthese letters to the post-office.  But he blankly declined.  So, much to\r\nmy inconvenience, I went myself.\r\n\r\nStill added days went by.  Whether Bartleby's eyes improved or not, I\r\ncould not say.  To all appearance, I thought they did.  But when I asked\r\nhim if they did, he vouchsafed no answer.  At all events, he would do no\r\ncopying.  At last, in reply to my urgings, he informed me that he had\r\npermanently given up copying.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed I; \"suppose your eyes should get entirely well--better\r\nthan ever before--would you not copy then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have given up copying,\" he answered, and slid aside.\r\n\r\nHe remained as ever, a fixture in my chamber.  Nay--if that were\r\npossible--he became still more of a fixture than before.  What was to be\r\ndone?  He would do nothing in the office: why should he stay there?  In\r\nplain fact, he had now become a millstone to me, not only useless as a\r\nnecklace, but afflictive to bear.  Yet I was sorry for him.  I speak\r\nless than truth when I say that, on his own account, he occasioned me\r\nuneasiness.  If he would but have named a single relative or friend, I\r\nwould instantly have written, and urged their taking the poor fellow\r\naway to some convenient retreat.  But he seemed alone, absolutely alone\r\nin the universe.  A bit of wreck in the mid Atlantic.  At length,\r\nnecessities connected with my business tyrannized over all other\r\nconsiderations.  Decently as I could, I told Bartleby that in six days'\r\ntime he must unconditionally leave the office.  I warned him to take\r\nmeasures, in the interval, for procuring some other abode.  I offered to\r\nassist him in this endeavor, if he himself would but take the first step\r\ntowards a removal.  \"And when you finally quit me, Bartleby,\" added I,\r\n\"I shall see that you go not away entirely unprovided.  Six days from\r\nthis hour, remember.\"\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of that period, I peeped behind the screen, and lo!\r\nBartleby was there.\r\n\r\nI buttoned up my coat, balanced myself; advanced slowly towards him,\r\ntouched his shoulder, and said, \"The time has come; you must quit this\r\nplace; I am sorry for you; here is money; but you must go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer not,\" he replied, with his back still towards me.\r\n\r\n\"You _must_.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained silent.\r\n\r\nNow I had an unbounded confidence in this man's common honesty.  He had\r\nfrequently restored to me sixpences and shillings carelessly dropped\r\nupon the floor, for I am apt to be very reckless in such shirt-button\r\naffairs.  The proceeding then which followed will not be deemed\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" said I, \"I owe you twelve dollars on account; here are\r\nthirty-two; the odd twenty are yours.--Will you take it?\" and I handed\r\nthe bills towards him.\r\n\r\nBut he made no motion.\r\n\r\n\"I will leave them here then,\" putting them under a weight on the table.\r\nThen taking my hat and cane and going to the door I tranquilly turned\r\nand added--\"After you have removed your things from these offices,\r\nBartleby, you will of course lock the door--since every one is now gone\r\nfor the day but you--and if you please, slip your key underneath the\r\nmat, so that I may have it in the morning.  I shall not see you again;\r\nso good-bye to you.  If hereafter in your new place of abode I can be of\r\nany service to you, do not fail to advise me by letter.  Good-bye,\r\nBartleby, and fare you well.\"\r\n\r\nBut he answered not a word; like the last column of some ruined temple,\r\nhe remained standing mute and solitary in the middle of the otherwise\r\ndeserted room.\r\n\r\nAs I walked home in a pensive mood, my vanity got the better of my pity.\r\nI could not but highly plume myself on my masterly management in getting\r\nrid of Bartleby.  Masterly I call it, and such it must appear to any\r\ndispassionate thinker.  The beauty of my procedure seemed to consist in\r\nits perfect quietness.  There was no vulgar bullying, no bravado of any\r\nsort, no choleric hectoring, and striding to and fro across the\r\napartment, jerking out vehement commands for Bartleby to bundle himself\r\noff with his beggarly traps.  Nothing of the kind.  Without loudly\r\nbidding Bartleby depart--as an inferior genius might have done--I\r\n_assumed_ the ground that depart he must; and upon that assumption built\r\nall I had to say.  The more I thought over my procedure, the more I was\r\ncharmed with it.  Nevertheless, next morning, upon awakening, I had my\r\ndoubts,--I had somehow slept off the fumes of vanity.  One of the\r\ncoolest and wisest hours a man has, is just after he awakes in the\r\nmorning.  My procedure seemed as sagacious as ever.--but only in theory.\r\nHow it would prove in practice--there was the rub.  It was truly a\r\nbeautiful thought to have assumed Bartleby's departure; but, after all,\r\nthat assumption was simply my own, and none of Bartleby's.  The great\r\npoint was, not whether I had assumed that he would quit me, but whether\r\nhe would prefer so to do.  He was more a man of preferences than\r\nassumptions.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, I walked down town, arguing the probabilities _pro_ and\r\n_con_.  One moment I thought it would prove a miserable failure, and\r\nBartleby would be found all alive at my office as usual; the next moment\r\nit seemed certain that I should see his chair empty.  And so I kept\r\nveering about.  At the corner of Broadway and Canal-street, I saw quite\r\nan excited group of people standing in earnest conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take odds he doesn't,\" said a voice as I passed.\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't go?--done!\" said I, \"put up your money.\"\r\n\r\nI was instinctively putting my hand in my pocket to produce my own, when\r\nI remembered that this was an election day.  The words I had overheard\r\nbore no reference to Bartleby, but to the success or non-success of some\r\ncandidate for the mayoralty.  In my intent frame of mind, I had, as it\r\nwere, imagined that all Broadway shared in my excitement, and were\r\ndebating the same question with me.  I passed on, very thankful that the\r\nuproar of the street screened my momentary absent-mindedness.\r\n\r\nAs I had intended, I was earlier than usual at my office door.  I stood\r\nlistening for a moment.  All was still.  He must be gone.  I tried the\r\nknob.  The door was locked.  Yes, my procedure had worked to a charm; he\r\nindeed must be vanished.  Yet a certain melancholy mixed with this: I\r\nwas almost sorry for my brilliant success.  I was fumbling under the\r\ndoor mat for the key, which Bartleby was to have left there for me, when\r\naccidentally my knee knocked against a panel, producing a summoning\r\nsound, and in response a voice came to me from within--\"Not yet; I am\r\noccupied.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Bartleby.\r\n\r\nI was thunderstruck.  For an instant I stood like the man who, pipe in\r\nmouth, was killed one cloudless afternoon long ago in Virginia, by a\r\nsummer lightning; at his own warm open window he was killed, and\r\nremained leaning out there upon the dreamy afternoon, till some one\r\ntouched him, when he fell.\r\n\r\n\"Not gone!\" I murmured at last.  But again obeying that wondrous\r\nascendancy which the inscrutable scrivener had over me, and from which\r\nascendancy, for all my chafing, I could not completely escape, I slowly\r\nwent down stairs and out into the street, and while walking round the\r\nblock, considered what I should next do in this unheard-of perplexity.\r\nTurn the man out by an actual thrusting I could not; to drive him away\r\nby calling him hard names would not do; calling in the police was an\r\nunpleasant idea; and yet, permit him to enjoy his cadaverous triumph\r\nover me,--this too I could not think of.  What was to be done? or, if\r\nnothing could be done, was there any thing further that I could _assume_\r\nin the matter?  Yes, as before I had prospectively assumed that Bartleby\r\nwould depart, so now I might retrospectively assume that departed he\r\nwas.  In the legitimate carrying out of this assumption, I might enter\r\nmy office in a great hurry, and pretending not to see Bartleby at all,\r\nwalk straight against him as if he were air.  Such a proceeding would in\r\na singular degree have the appearance of a home-thrust.  It was hardly\r\npossible that Bartleby could withstand such an application of the\r\ndoctrine of assumptions.  But upon second thoughts the success of the\r\nplan seemed rather dubious.  I resolved to argue the matter over with\r\nhim again.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" said I, entering the office, with a quietly severe\r\nexpression, \"I am seriously displeased.  I am pained, Bartleby.  I had\r\nthought better of you.  I had imagined you of such a gentlemanly\r\norganization, that in any delicate dilemma a slight hint would have\r\nsuffice--in short, an assumption.  But it appears I am deceived.  Why,\"\r\nI added, unaffectedly starting, \"you have not even touched that money\r\nyet,\" pointing to it, just where I had left it the evening previous.\r\n\r\nHe answered nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Will you, or will you not, quit me?\" I now demanded in a sudden\r\npassion, advancing close to him.\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer _not_ to quit you,\" he replied, gently emphasizing the\r\n_not_.\r\n\r\n\"What earthly right have you to stay here?  Do you pay any rent?  Do you\r\npay my taxes?  Or is this property yours?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ready to go on and write now?  Are your eyes recovered?  Could\r\nyou copy a small paper for me this morning? or help examine a few lines?\r\nor step round to the post-office?  In a word, will you do any thing at\r\nall, to give a coloring to your refusal to depart the premises?\"\r\n\r\nHe silently retired into his hermitage.\r\n\r\nI was now in such a state of nervous resentment that I thought it but\r\nprudent to check myself at present from further demonstrations.\r\nBartleby and I were alone.  I remembered the tragedy of the unfortunate\r\nAdams and the still more unfortunate Colt in the solitary office of the\r\nlatter; and how poor Colt, being dreadfully incensed by Adams, and\r\nimprudently permitting himself to get wildly excited, was at unawares\r\nhurried into his fatal act--an act which certainly no man could possibly\r\ndeplore more than the actor himself.  Often it had occurred to me in my\r\nponderings upon the subject, that had that altercation taken place in\r\nthe public street, or at a private residence, it would not have\r\nterminated as it did.  It was the circumstance of being alone in a\r\nsolitary office, up stairs, of a building entirely unhallowed by\r\nhumanizing domestic associations--an uncarpeted office, doubtless, of a\r\ndusty, haggard sort of appearance;--this it must have been, which\r\ngreatly helped to enhance the irritable desperation of the hapless Colt.\r\n\r\nBut when this old Adam of resentment rose in me and tempted me\r\nconcerning Bartleby, I grappled him and threw him.  How?  Why, simply by\r\nrecalling the divine injunction: \"A new commandment give I unto you,\r\nthat ye love one another.\"  Yes, this it was that saved me.  Aside from\r\nhigher considerations, charity often operates as a vastly wise and\r\nprudent principle--a great safeguard to its possessor.  Men have\r\ncommitted murder for jealousy's sake, and anger's sake, and hatred's\r\nsake, and selfishness' sake, and spiritual pride's sake; but no man that\r\never I heard of, ever committed a diabolical murder for sweet charity's\r\nsake.  Mere self-interest, then, if no better motive can be enlisted,\r\nshould, especially with high-tempered men, prompt all beings to charity\r\nand philanthropy.  At any rate, upon the occasion in question, I strove\r\nto drown my exasperated feelings towards the scrivener by benevolently\r\nconstruing his conduct.  Poor fellow, poor fellow! thought I, he don't\r\nmean any thing; and besides, he has seen hard times, and ought to be\r\nindulged.\r\n\r\nI endeavored also immediately to occupy myself, and at the same time to\r\ncomfort my despondency.  I tried to fancy that in the course of the\r\nmorning, at such time as might prove agreeable to him,  Bartleby, of his\r\nown free accord, would emerge from his hermitage, and take up some\r\ndecided line of march in the direction of the door.  But no.  Half-past\r\ntwelve o'clock came; Turkey began to glow in the face, overturn his\r\ninkstand, and become generally obstreperous; Nippers abated down into\r\nquietude and courtesy; Ginger Nut munched his noon apple; and Bartleby\r\nremained standing at his window in one of his profoundest dead-wall\r\nreveries.  Will it be credited?  Ought I to acknowledge it?  That\r\nafternoon I left the office without saying one further word to him.\r\n\r\nSome days now passed, during which, at leisure intervals I looked a\r\nlittle into \"Edwards on the Will,\" and \"Priestly on Necessity.\"  Under\r\nthe circumstances, those books induced a salutary feeling.  Gradually I\r\nslid into the persuasion that these troubles of mine touching the\r\nscrivener, had been all predestinated from eternity, and Bartleby was\r\nbilleted upon me for some mysterious purpose of an all-wise Providence,\r\nwhich it was not for a mere mortal like me to fathom.  Yes, Bartleby,\r\nstay there behind your screen, thought I; I shall persecute you no more;\r\nyou are harmless and noiseless as any of these old chairs; in short, I\r\nnever feel so private as when I know you are here.  At last I see it, I\r\nfeel it; I penetrate to the predestinated purpose of my life.  I am\r\ncontent.  Others may have loftier parts to enact; but my mission in this\r\nworld, Bartleby, is to furnish you with office-room for such period as\r\nyou may see fit to remain.\r\n\r\nI believe that this wise and blessed frame of mind would have continued\r\nwith me, had it not been for the unsolicited and uncharitable remarks\r\nobtruded upon me by my professional friends who visited the rooms.  But\r\nthus it often is, that the constant friction of illiberal minds wears\r\nout at last the best resolves of the more generous.  Though to be sure,\r\nwhen I reflected upon it, it was not strange that people entering my\r\noffice should be struck by the peculiar aspect of the unaccountable\r\nBartleby, and so be tempted to throw out some sinister observations\r\nconcerning him.  Sometimes an attorney having business with me, and\r\ncalling at my office and finding no one but the scrivener there, would\r\nundertake to obtain some sort of precise information from him touching\r\nmy whereabouts; but without heeding his idle talk, Bartleby would remain\r\nstanding immovable in the middle of the room.  So after contemplating\r\nhim in that position for a time, the attorney would depart, no wiser\r\nthan he came.\r\n\r\nAlso, when a Reference was going on, and the room full of lawyers and\r\nwitnesses and business was driving fast; some deeply occupied legal\r\ngentleman present, seeing Bartleby wholly unemployed, would request him\r\nto run round to his (the legal gentleman's) office and fetch some papers\r\nfor him.  Thereupon, Bartleby would tranquilly decline, and yet remain\r\nidle as before.  Then the lawyer would give a great stare, and turn to\r\nme.  And what could I say?  At last I was made aware that all through\r\nthe circle of my professional acquaintance, a whisper of wonder was\r\nrunning round, having reference to the strange creature I kept at my\r\noffice.  This worried me very much.  And as the idea came upon me of his\r\npossibly turning out a long-lived man, and keep occupying my chambers,\r\nand denying my authority; and perplexing my visitors; and scandalizing\r\nmy professional reputation; and casting a general gloom over the\r\npremises; keeping soul and body together to the last upon his savings\r\n(for doubtless he spent but half a dime a day), and in the end perhaps\r\noutlive me, and claim possession of my office by right of his perpetual\r\noccupancy: as all these dark anticipations crowded upon me more and\r\nmore, and my friends continually intruded their relentless remarks upon\r\nthe apparition in my room; a great change was wrought in me.  I resolved\r\nto gather all my faculties together, and for ever rid me of this\r\nintolerable incubus.\r\n\r\nEre revolving any complicated project, however, adapted to this end, I\r\nfirst simply suggested to Bartleby the propriety of his permanent\r\ndeparture.  In a calm and serious tone, I commended the idea to his\r\ncareful and mature consideration.  But having taken three days to\r\nmeditate upon it, he apprised me that his original determination\r\nremained the same; in short, that he still preferred to abide with me.\r\n\r\nWhat shall I do?  I now said to myself, buttoning up my coat to the last\r\nbutton.  What shall I do? what ought I to do? what does conscience say I\r\n_should_ do with this man, or rather ghost.  Rid myself of him, I must;\r\ngo, he shall.  But how?  You will not thrust him, the poor, pale,\r\npassive mortal,--you will not thrust such a helpless creature out of\r\nyour door? you will not dishonor yourself by such cruelty?  No, I will\r\nnot, I cannot do that.  Rather would I let him live and die here, and\r\nthen mason up his remains in the wall.  What then will you do?  For all\r\nyour coaxing, he will not budge.  Bribes he leaves under your own\r\npaperweight on your table; in short, it is quite plain that he prefers\r\nto cling to you.\r\n\r\nThen something severe, something unusual must be done.  What! surely you\r\nwill not have him collared by a constable, and commit his innocent\r\npallor to the common jail?  And upon what ground could you procure such\r\na thing to be done?--a vagrant, is he?  What! he a vagrant, a wanderer,\r\nwho refuses to budge?  It is because he will _not_ be a vagrant, then,\r\nthat you seek to count him _as_ a vagrant.  That is too absurd.  No\r\nvisible means of support:  there I have him.  Wrong again:  for\r\nindubitably he _does_ support himself, and that is the only unanswerable\r\nproof that any man can show of his possessing the means so to do.  No\r\nmore then.  Since he will not quit me, I must quit him.  I will change\r\nmy offices; I will move elsewhere; and give him fair notice, that if I\r\nfind him on my new premises I will then proceed against him as a common\r\ntrespasser.\r\n\r\nActing accordingly, next day I thus addressed him:  \"I find these\r\nchambers too far from the City Hall; the air is unwholesome.  In a word,\r\nI propose to remove my offices next week, and shall no longer require\r\nyour services.  I tell you this now, in order that you may seek another\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, and nothing more was said.\r\n\r\nOn the appointed day I engaged carts and men, proceeded to my chambers,\r\nand having but little furniture, every thing was removed in a few hours.\r\nThroughout, the scrivener remained standing behind the screen, which I\r\ndirected to be removed the last thing.  It was withdrawn; and being\r\nfolded up like a huge folio, left him the motionless occupant of a naked\r\nroom.  I stood in the entry watching him a moment, while something from\r\nwithin me upbraided me.\r\n\r\nI re-entered, with my hand in my pocket--and--and my heart in my mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Bartleby; I am going--good-bye, and God some way bless you;\r\nand take that,\" slipping something in his hand.  But it dropped upon the\r\nfloor, and then,--strange to say--I tore myself from him whom I had so\r\nlonged to be rid of.\r\n\r\nEstablished in my new quarters, for a day or two I kept the door locked,\r\nand started at every footfall in the passages.  When I returned to my\r\nrooms after any little absence, I would pause at the threshold for an\r\ninstant, and attentively listen, ere applying my key.  But these fears\r\nwere needless.  Bartleby never came nigh me.\r\n\r\nI thought all was going well, when a perturbed looking stranger visited\r\nme, inquiring whether I was the person who had recently occupied rooms\r\nat No.--Wall-street.\r\n\r\nFull of forebodings, I replied that I was.\r\n\r\n\"Then sir,\" said the stranger, who proved a lawyer, \"you are responsible\r\nfor the man you left there.  He refuses to do any copying; he refuses to\r\ndo any thing; he says he prefers not to; and he refuses to quit the\r\npremises.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry, sir,\" said I, with assumed tranquility, but an inward\r\ntremor, \"but, really, the man you allude to is nothing to me--he is no\r\nrelation or apprentice of mine, that you should hold me responsible for\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"In mercy's name, who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly cannot inform you.  I know nothing about him.  Formerly I\r\nemployed him as a copyist; but he has done nothing for me now for some\r\ntime past.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall settle him then,--good morning, sir.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed, and I heard nothing more; and though I often felt a\r\ncharitable prompting to call at the place and see poor Bartleby, yet a\r\ncertain squeamishness of I know not what withheld me.\r\n\r\nAll is over with him, by this time, thought I at last, when through\r\nanother week no further intelligence reached me.  But coming to my room\r\nthe day after, I found several persons waiting at my door in a high\r\nstate of nervous excitement.\r\n\r\n\"That's the man--here he comes,\" cried the foremost one, whom I\r\nrecognized as the lawyer who had previously called upon me alone.\r\n\r\n\"You must take him away, sir, at once,\" cried a portly person among\r\nthem, advancing upon me, and whom I knew to be the landlord of\r\nNo.--Wall-street.  \"These gentlemen, my tenants, cannot stand it any\r\nlonger; Mr. B--\" pointing to the lawyer, \"has turned him out of his\r\nroom, and he now persists in haunting the building generally, sitting\r\nupon the banisters of the stairs by day, and sleeping in the entry by\r\nnight.  Every body is concerned; clients are leaving the offices; some\r\nfears are entertained of a mob; something you must do, and that without\r\ndelay.\"\r\n\r\nAghast at this torrent, I fell back before it, and would fain have\r\nlocked myself in my new quarters.  In vain I persisted that Bartleby was\r\nnothing to me--no more than to any one else.  In vain:--I was the last\r\nperson known to have any thing to do with him, and they held me to the\r\nterrible account.  Fearful then of being exposed in the papers (as one\r\nperson present obscurely threatened) I considered the matter, and at\r\nlength said, that if the lawyer would give me a confidential interview\r\nwith the scrivener, in his (the lawyer's) own room, I would that\r\nafternoon strive my best to rid them of the nuisance they complained of.\r\n\r\nGoing up stairs to my old haunt, there was Bartleby silently sitting\r\nupon the banister at the landing.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here, Bartleby?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Sitting upon the banister,\" he mildly replied.\r\n\r\nI motioned him into the lawyer's room, who then left us.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" said I, \"are you aware that you are the cause of great\r\ntribulation to me, by persisting in occupying the entry after being\r\ndismissed from the office?\"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\"Now one of two things must take place.  Either you must do something,\r\nor something must be done to you.  Now what sort of business would you\r\nlike to engage in?  Would you like to re-engage in copying for some\r\none?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I would prefer not to make any change.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like a clerkship in a dry-goods store?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is too much confinement about that.  No, I would not like a\r\nclerkship; but I am not particular.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too much confinement,\" I cried, \"why you keep yourself confined all the\r\ntime!\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer not to take a clerkship,\" he rejoined, as if to settle\r\nthat little item at once.\r\n\r\n\"How would a bar-tender's business suit you?  There is no trying of the\r\neyesight in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not like it at all; though, as I said before, I am not\r\nparticular.\"\r\n\r\nHis unwonted wordiness inspirited me.  I returned to the charge.\r\n\r\n\"Well then, would you like to travel through the country collecting\r\nbills for the merchants?  That would improve your health.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I would prefer to be doing something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"How then would going as a companion to Europe, to entertain some young\r\ngentleman with your conversation,--how would that suit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.  It does not strike me that there is any thing definite\r\nabout that.  I like to be stationary.  But I am not particular.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stationary you shall be then,\" I cried, now losing all patience, and\r\nfor the first time in all my exasperating connection with him fairly\r\nflying into a passion.  \"If you do not go away from these premises\r\nbefore night, I shall feel bound--indeed I _am_ bound--to--to--to quit\r\nthe premises myself!\"  I rather absurdly concluded, knowing not with\r\nwhat possible threat to try to frighten his immobility into compliance.\r\nDespairing of all further efforts, I was precipitately leaving him, when\r\na final thought occurred to me--one which had not been wholly unindulged\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby,\" said I, in the kindest tone I could assume under such\r\nexciting circumstances, \"will you go home with me now--not to my office,\r\nbut my dwelling--and remain there till we can conclude upon some\r\nconvenient arrangement for you at our leisure?  Come, let us start now,\r\nright away.\"\r\n\r\n\"No:  at present I would prefer not to make any change at all.\"\r\n\r\nI answered nothing; but effectually dodging every one by the suddenness\r\nand rapidity of my flight, rushed from the building, ran up Wall-street\r\ntowards Broadway, and jumping into the first omnibus was soon removed\r\nfrom pursuit.  As soon as tranquility returned I distinctly perceived\r\nthat I had now done all that I possibly could, both in respect to the\r\ndemands of the landlord and his tenants, and with regard to my own\r\ndesire and sense of duty, to benefit Bartleby, and shield him from rude\r\npersecution.  I now strove to be entirely care-free and quiescent; and\r\nmy conscience justified me in the attempt; though indeed it was not so\r\nsuccessful as I could have wished.  So fearful was I of being again\r\nhunted out by the incensed landlord and his exasperated tenants, that,\r\nsurrendering my business to Nippers, for a few days I drove about the\r\nupper part of the town and through the suburbs, in my rockaway; crossed\r\nover to Jersey City and Hoboken, and paid fugitive visits to\r\nManhattanville and Astoria.  In fact I almost lived in my rockaway for\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nWhen again I entered my office, lo, a note from the landlord lay upon\r\nthe desk.  I opened it with trembling hands.  It informed me that the\r\nwriter had sent to the police, and had Bartleby removed to the Tombs as\r\na vagrant.  Moreover, since I knew more about him than any one else, he\r\nwished me to appear at that place, and make a suitable statement of the\r\nfacts.  These tidings had a conflicting effect upon me.  At first I was\r\nindignant; but at last almost approved.  The landlord's energetic,\r\nsummary disposition had led him to adopt a procedure which I do not\r\nthink I would have decided upon myself; and yet as a last resort, under\r\nsuch peculiar circumstances, it seemed the only plan.\r\n\r\nAs I afterwards learned, the poor scrivener, when told that he must be\r\nconducted to the Tombs, offered not the slightest obstacle, but in his\r\npale unmoving way, silently acquiesced.\r\n\r\nSome of the compassionate and curious bystanders joined the party; and\r\nheaded by one of the constables arm in arm with Bartleby, the silent\r\nprocession filed its way through all the noise, and heat, and joy of the\r\nroaring thoroughfares at noon.\r\n\r\nThe same day I received the note I went to the Tombs, or to speak more\r\nproperly, the Halls of Justice.  Seeking the right officer, I stated the\r\npurpose of my call, and was informed that the individual I described was\r\nindeed within.  I then assured the functionary that Bartleby was a\r\nperfectly honest man, and greatly to be compassionated, however\r\nunaccountably eccentric.  I narrated all I knew, and closed by\r\nsuggesting the idea of letting him remain in as indulgent confinement as\r\npossible till something less harsh might be done--though indeed I hardly\r\nknew what.  At all events, if nothing else could be decided upon, the\r\nalms-house must receive him.  I then begged to have an interview.\r\n\r\nBeing under no disgraceful charge, and quite serene and harmless in all\r\nhis ways, they had permitted him freely to wander about the prison, and\r\nespecially in the inclosed grass-platted yard thereof.  And so I found\r\nhim there, standing all alone in the quietest of the yards, his face\r\ntowards a high wall, while all around, from the narrow slits of the jail\r\nwindows, I thought I saw peering out upon him the eyes of murderers and\r\nthieves.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you,\" he said, without looking round,--\"and I want nothing to\r\nsay to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not I that brought you here, Bartleby,\" said I, keenly pained at\r\nhis implied suspicion.  \"And to you, this should not be so vile a place.\r\nNothing reproachful attaches to you by being here.  And see, it is not\r\nso sad a place as one might think.  Look, there is the sky, and here is\r\nthe grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know where I am,\" he replied, but would say nothing more, and so I\r\nleft him.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the corridor again, a broad meat-like man, in an apron,\r\naccosted me, and jerking his thumb over his shoulder said--\"Is that your\r\nfriend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he want to starve?  If he does, let him live on the prison fare,\r\nthat's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked I, not knowing what to make of such an unofficially\r\nspeaking person in such a place.\r\n\r\n\"I am the grub-man.  Such gentlemen as have friends here, hire me to\r\nprovide them with something good to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this so?\" said I, turning to the turnkey.\r\n\r\nHe said it was.\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" said I, slipping some silver into the grub-man's hands (for\r\nso they called him).  \"I want you to give particular attention to my\r\nfriend there; let him have the best dinner you can get.  And you must be\r\nas polite to him as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Introduce me, will you?\" said the grub-man, looking at me with an\r\nexpression which seem to say he was all impatience for an opportunity to\r\ngive a specimen of his breeding.\r\n\r\nThinking it would prove of benefit to the scrivener, I acquiesced; and\r\nasking the grub-man his name, went up with him to Bartleby.\r\n\r\n\"Bartleby, this is Mr. Cutlets; you will find him very useful to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your sarvant, sir, your sarvant,\" said the grub-man, making a low\r\nsalutation behind his apron.  \"Hope you find it pleasant here,\r\nsir;--spacious grounds--cool apartments, sir--hope you'll stay with us\r\nsome time--try to make it agreeable.  May Mrs. Cutlets and I have the\r\npleasure of your company to dinner, sir, in Mrs. Cutlets' private room?\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer not to dine to-day,\" said Bartleby, turning away.  \"It would\r\ndisagree with me; I am unused to dinners.\"  So saying he slowly moved to\r\nthe other side of the inclosure, and took up a position fronting the\r\ndead-wall.\r\n\r\n\"How's this?\" said the grub-man, addressing me with a stare of\r\nastonishment.  \"He's odd, aint he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he is a little deranged,\" said I, sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Deranged? deranged is it?  Well now, upon my word, I thought that\r\nfriend of yourn was a gentleman forger; they are always pale and\r\ngenteel-like, them forgers.  I can't pity'em--can't help it, sir.  Did\r\nyou know Monroe Edwards?\" he added touchingly, and paused.  Then, laying\r\nhis hand pityingly on my shoulder, sighed, \"he died of consumption at\r\nSing-Sing.  So you weren't acquainted with Monroe?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I was never socially acquainted with any forgers.  But I cannot\r\nstop longer.  Look to my friend yonder.  You will not lose by it.  I\r\nwill see you again.\"\r\n\r\nSome few days after this, I again obtained admission to the Tombs, and\r\nwent through the corridors in quest of Bartleby; but without finding\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"I saw him coming from his cell not long ago,\" said a turnkey, \"may be\r\nhe's gone to loiter in the yards.\"\r\n\r\nSo I went in that direction.\r\n\r\n\"Are you looking for the silent man?\" said another turnkey passing me.\r\n\"Yonder he lies--sleeping in the yard there.  'Tis not twenty minutes\r\nsince I saw him lie down.\"\r\n\r\nThe yard was entirely quiet.  It was not accessible to the common\r\nprisoners.  The surrounding walls, of amazing thickness, kept off all\r\nsounds behind them.  The Egyptian character of the masonry weighed upon\r\nme with its gloom.  But a soft imprisoned turf grew under foot.  The\r\nheart of the eternal pyramids, it seemed, wherein, by some strange\r\nmagic, through the clefts, grass-seed, dropped by birds, had sprung.\r\n\r\nStrangely huddled at the base of the wall, his knees drawn up, and lying\r\non his side, his head touching the cold stones, I saw the wasted\r\nBartleby.  But nothing stirred.  I paused; then went close up to him;\r\nstooped over, and saw that his dim eyes were open; otherwise he seemed\r\nprofoundly sleeping.  Something prompted me to touch him.  I felt his\r\nhand, when a tingling shiver ran up my arm and down my spine to my feet.\r\n\r\nThe round face of the grub-man peered upon me now.  \"His dinner is\r\nready.  Won't he dine to-day, either?  Or does he live without dining?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lives without dining,\" said I, and closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Eh!--He's asleep, aint he?\"\r\n\r\n\"With kings and counselors,\" murmured I.\r\n\r\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\nThere would seem little need for proceeding further in this history.\r\nImagination will readily supply the meager recital of poor Bartleby's\r\ninterment.  But ere parting with the reader, let me say, that if this\r\nlittle narrative has sufficiently interested him, to awaken curiosity as\r\nto who Bartleby was, and what manner of life he led prior to the present\r\nnarrator's making his acquaintance, I can only reply, that in such\r\ncuriosity I fully share, but am wholly unable to gratify it.  Yet here I\r\nhardly know whether I should divulge one little item of rumor, which\r\ncame to my ear a few months after the scrivener's decease.  Upon what\r\nbasis it rested, I could never ascertain; and hence, how true it is I\r\ncannot now tell.  But inasmuch as this vague report has not been without\r\ncertain strange suggestive interest to me, however sad, it may prove the\r\nsame with some others; and so I will briefly mention it.  The report was\r\nthis:  that Bartleby had been a subordinate clerk in the Dead Letter\r\nOffice at Washington, from which he had been suddenly removed by a\r\nchange in the administration.  When I think over this rumor, I cannot\r\nadequately express the emotions which seize me.  Dead letters! does it\r\nnot sound like dead men?  Conceive a man by nature and misfortune prone\r\nto a pallid hopelessness, can any business seem more fitted to heighten\r\nit than that of continually handling these dead letters, and assorting\r\nthem for the flames?  For by the cart-load they are annually burned.\r\nSometimes from out the folded paper the pale clerk takes a ring:--the\r\nfinger it was meant for, perhaps, moulders in the grave; a bank-note\r\nsent in swiftest charity:--he whom it would relieve, nor eats nor\r\nhungers any more; pardon for those who died despairing; hope for those\r\nwho died unhoping; good tidings for those who died stifled by unrelieved\r\ncalamities.  On errands of life, these letters speed to death.\r\n\r\nAh Bartleby!  Ah humanity!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Bartleby, The Scrivener, by Herman Melville\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BARTLEBY, THE SCRIVENER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 11231.txt or 11231.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/1/2/3/11231/\r\n\r\nProduced by Steve J.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.

For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\r\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\r\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\r\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\r\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\r\ndownload by the etext year.\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06\r\n\r\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\r\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\r\n\r\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\r\nfiled in a different way.

He lay on\r\nhis armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could\r\nsee his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff\r\nsections.  The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready\r\nto slide off any moment.  His many legs, pitifully thin compared\r\nwith the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he\r\nlooked.\r\n\r\n\"What's happened to me?\" he thought.  It wasn't a dream.  His room,\r\na proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully\r\nbetween its four familiar walls.  A collection of textile samples\r\nlay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and\r\nabove it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an\r\nillustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.  It showed\r\na lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright,\r\nraising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm\r\ntowards the viewer.\r\n\r\nGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.\r\nDrops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel\r\nquite sad.  \"How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all\r\nthis nonsense\", he thought, but that was something he was unable to\r\ndo because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present\r\nstate couldn't get into that position.  However hard he threw\r\nhimself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.  He\r\nmust have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he\r\nwouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when\r\nhe began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, God\", he thought, \"what a strenuous career it is that I've\r\nchosen! Travelling day in and day out.  Doing business like this\r\ntakes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on\r\ntop of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making\r\ntrain connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different\r\npeople all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or\r\nbecome friendly with them.  It can all go to Hell!\"  He felt a\r\nslight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back\r\ntowards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found\r\nwhere the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little\r\nwhite spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried\r\nto feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back\r\nbecause as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.\r\n\r\nHe slid back into his former position.  \"Getting up early all the\r\ntime\", he thought, \"it makes you stupid.  You've got to get enough\r\nsleep.  Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury.  For\r\ninstance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning\r\nto copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting\r\nthere eating their breakfasts.  I ought to just try that with my\r\nboss; I'd get kicked out on the spot.  But who knows, maybe that\r\nwould be the best thing for me.  If I didn't have my parents to\r\nthink about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have\r\ngone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him\r\neverything I would, let him know just what I feel.  He'd fall right\r\noff his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up\r\nthere at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,\r\nespecially when you have to go right up close because the boss is\r\nhard of hearing.  Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the\r\nmoney together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or\r\nsix years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do.  That's when\r\nI'll make the big change.  First of all though, I've got to get up,\r\nmy train leaves at five.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of\r\ndrawers.  \"God in Heaven!\" he thought.  It was half past six and the\r\nhands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half\r\npast, more like quarter to seven.  Had the alarm clock not rung? He\r\ncould see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it\r\nshould have been; it certainly must have rung.  Yes, but was it\r\npossible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?\r\nTrue, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply\r\nbecause of that.  What should he do now? The next train went at\r\nseven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and\r\nthe collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at\r\nall feel particularly fresh and lively.  And even if he did catch\r\nthe train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office\r\nassistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, he\r\nwould have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long\r\ntime ago.  The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and\r\nwith no understanding.  What about if he reported sick? But that\r\nwould be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of\r\nservice Gregor had never once yet been ill.  His boss would\r\ncertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance\r\ncompany, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the\r\ndoctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed\r\nthat no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.  And what's\r\nmore, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in\r\nfact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long,\r\nfeel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.\r\n\r\nHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide\r\nto get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven.\r\nThere was a cautious knock at the door near his head.  \"Gregor\",\r\nsomebody called - it was his mother - \"it's quarter to seven.\r\nDidn't you want to go somewhere?\"  That gentle voice! Gregor was\r\nshocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be\r\nrecognised as the voice he had had before.  As if from deep inside\r\nhim, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with\r\nit, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort\r\nof echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether\r\nhe had heard properly or not.  Gregor had wanted to give a full\r\nanswer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented\r\nhimself with saying: \"Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I'm getting up\r\nnow.\"  The change in Gregor's voice probably could not be noticed\r\noutside through the wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with\r\nthis explanation and shuffled away.  But this short conversation\r\nmade the other members of the family aware that Gregor, against\r\ntheir expectations was still at home, and soon his father came\r\nknocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist.\r\n\"Gregor, Gregor\", he called, \"what's wrong?\"  And after a short\r\nwhile he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: \"Gregor!\r\nGregor!\"  At the other side door his sister came plaintively:\r\n\"Gregor? Aren't you well? Do you need anything?\"  Gregor answered to\r\nboth sides: \"I'm ready, now\", making an effort to remove all the\r\nstrangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting\r\nlong pauses between each, individual word.  His father went back to\r\nhis breakfast, but his sister whispered: \"Gregor, open the door, I\r\nbeg of you.\"  Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door,\r\nand instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired\r\nfrom his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being\r\ndisturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast.\r\nOnly then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware\r\nthat he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by\r\nlying in bed.  He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in\r\nbed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned\r\nout to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would\r\nslowly resolve themselves today.  He did not have the slightest\r\ndoubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first\r\nsign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for\r\ntravelling salesmen.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow\r\nhimself up a little and they fell off by themselves.  But it became\r\ndifficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad.\r\nHe would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but\r\ninstead of them he only had all those little legs continuously\r\nmoving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to\r\ncontrol.  If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first\r\none that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do\r\nwhat he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free\r\nand would move about painfully.  \"This is something that can't be\r\ndone in bed\", Gregor said to himself, \"so don't keep trying to do\r\nit\".\r\n\r\nThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body\r\nout of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not\r\nimagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move;\r\nit went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he\r\ncarelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could\r\ngather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower\r\nbedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower\r\npart of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.\r\n\r\nSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed\r\nfirst, carefully turning his head to the side.  This he managed\r\nquite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of\r\nhis body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head.\r\nBut when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the\r\nfresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be\r\na miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry\r\non pushing himself forward the same way.  And he could not knock\r\nhimself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had been\r\nearlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching\r\nhis legs as they struggled against each other even harder than\r\nbefore, if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringing\r\npeace and order to this chaos.  He told himself once more that it\r\nwas not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible\r\nthing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at\r\nwhatever sacrifice.  At the same time, though, he did not forget to\r\nremind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing\r\nto desperate conclusions.  At times like this he would direct his\r\neyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but\r\nunfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was\r\nenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer\r\nto offer him.  \"Seven o'clock, already\", he said to himself when the\r\nclock struck again, \"seven o'clock, and there's still a fog like\r\nthis.\"  And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly\r\nas if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back\r\nto their real and natural state.\r\n\r\nBut then he said to himself: \"Before it strikes quarter past seven\r\nI'll definitely have to have got properly out of bed.  And by then\r\nsomebody will have come round from work to ask what's happened to me\r\nas well, as they open up at work before seven o'clock.\"  And so he\r\nset himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body\r\nout of the bed all at the same time.  If he succeeded in falling out\r\nof bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could\r\nprobably avoid injuring it.  His back seemed to be quite hard, and\r\nprobably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet.  His\r\nmain concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and which\r\neven through all the doors would probably raise concern if not\r\nalarm.  But it was something that had to be risked.\r\n\r\nWhen Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new\r\nmethod was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock\r\nback and forth - it occurred to him how simple everything would be\r\nif somebody came to help him.  Two strong people - he had his father\r\nand the maid in mind - would have been more than enough; they would\r\nonly have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him\r\naway from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and\r\ncareful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the\r\nlittle legs would find a use.  Should he really call for help\r\nthough, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked?\r\nDespite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile\r\nat this thought.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it would have\r\nbeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard.  The\r\ntime was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final\r\ndecision very soon.  Then there was a ring at the door of the flat.\r\n\"That'll be someone from work\", he said to himself, and froze very\r\nstill, although his little legs only became all the more lively as\r\nthey danced around.  For a moment everything remained quiet.\r\n\"They're not opening the door\", Gregor said to himself, caught in\r\nsome nonsensical hope.  But then of course, the maid's firm steps\r\nwent to the door as ever and opened it.  Gregor only needed to hear\r\nthe visitor's first words of greeting and he knew who it was - the\r\nchief clerk himself.  Why did Gregor have to be the only one\r\ncondemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly\r\nsuspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every\r\none of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and\r\ndevoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he\r\ncouldn't get out of bed if he didn't spend at least a couple of\r\nhours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough\r\nto let one of the trainees make enquiries - assuming enquiries were\r\neven necessary - did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did\r\nthey have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so\r\nsuspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the\r\nwisdom to investigate it? And more because these thoughts had made\r\nhim upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself with\r\nall his force out of the bed.  There was a loud thump, but it wasn't\r\nreally a loud noise.  His fall was softened a little by the carpet,\r\nand Gregor's back was also more elastic than he had thought, which\r\nmade the sound muffled and not too noticeable.  He had not held his\r\nhead carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in\r\npain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.\r\n\r\n\"Something's fallen down in there\", said the chief clerk in the room\r\non the left.  Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort\r\nthat had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk\r\ntoo; you had to concede that it was possible.  But as if in gruff\r\nreply to this question, the chief clerk's firm footsteps in his\r\nhighly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room.\r\nFrom the room on his right, Gregor's sister whispered to him to let\r\nhim know: \"Gregor, the chief clerk is here.\"  \"Yes, I know\", said\r\nGregor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough\r\nfor his sister to hear him.\r\n\r\n\"Gregor\", said his father now from the room to his left, \"the chief\r\nclerk has come round and wants to know why you didn't leave on the\r\nearly train.  We don't know what to say to him.  And anyway, he\r\nwants to speak to you personally.  So please open up this door.  I'm\r\nsure he'll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.\"\r\nThen the chief clerk called \"Good morning,  Mr. Samsa\". \"He isn't\r\nwell\", said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father\r\ncontinued to speak through the door.  \"He isn't well, please believe\r\nme.  Why else would Gregor have missed a train! The lad only ever\r\nthinks about the business.  It nearly makes me cross the way he\r\nnever goes out in the evenings; he's been in town for a week now but\r\nstayed home every evening.  He sits with us in the kitchen and just\r\nreads the paper or studies train timetables.  His idea of relaxation\r\nis working with his fretsaw.  He's made a little frame, for\r\ninstance, it only took him two or three evenings, you'll be amazed\r\nhow nice it is; it's hanging up in his room; you'll see it as soon\r\nas Gregor opens the door.  Anyway, I'm glad you're here; we wouldn't\r\nhave been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves; he's so\r\nstubborn; and I'm sure he isn't well, he said this morning that he\r\nis, but he isn't.\"  \"I'll be there in a moment\", said Gregor slowly\r\nand thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any\r\nword of the conversation.  \"Well I can't think of any other way of\r\nexplaining it,  Mrs. Samsa\", said the chief clerk, \"I hope it's\r\nnothing serious.  But on the other hand, I must say that if we\r\npeople in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or\r\nunfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of\r\nbusiness considerations.\"  \"Can the chief clerk come in to see you\r\nnow then?\", asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door\r\nagain.  \"No\", said Gregor.  In the room on his right there followed\r\na painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.\r\n\r\nSo why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably\r\nonly just got up and had not even begun to get dressed.  And why was\r\nshe crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the\r\nchief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if\r\nthat happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the\r\nsame demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like\r\nthat yet.  Gregor was still there and had not the slightest\r\nintention of abandoning his family.  For the time being he just lay\r\nthere on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in\r\nwould seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in.  It was\r\nonly a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be\r\nfound for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor could\r\nbe sacked on the spot.  And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible\r\nto leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at\r\nhim and crying.  But the others didn't know what was happening, they\r\nwere worried, that would excuse their behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe chief clerk now raised his voice, \"Mr. Samsa\", he called to him,\r\n\"what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more\r\nthan yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and\r\nunnecessary concern to your parents and you fail - and I mention\r\nthis just by the way - you fail to carry out your business duties in\r\na way that is quite unheard of.  I'm speaking here on behalf of your\r\nparents and of your employer, and really must request a clear and\r\nimmediate explanation.  I am astonished, quite astonished.  I\r\nthought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now you\r\nsuddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims.  This morning,\r\nyour employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to\r\nappear, it's true - it had to do with the money that was recently\r\nentrusted to you - but I came near to giving him my word of honour\r\nthat that could not be the right explanation.  But now that I see\r\nyour incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish\r\nwhatsoever to intercede on your behalf.  And nor is your position\r\nall that secure.  I had originally intended to say all this to you\r\nin private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good\r\nreason I don't see why your parents should not also learn of it.\r\nYour turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that\r\nit's not the time of year to do especially good business, we\r\nrecognise that; but there simply is no time of year to do no\r\nbusiness at all,  Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Sir\", called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in\r\nthe excitement, \"I'll open up immediately, just a moment.  I'm\r\nslightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven't been able to get\r\nup.  I'm still in bed now.  I'm quite fresh again now, though.  I'm\r\njust getting out of bed.  Just a moment.  Be patient! It's not quite\r\nas easy as I'd thought.  I'm quite alright now, though.  It's\r\nshocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright\r\nlast night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had\r\na small symptom of it last night already.  They must have noticed\r\nit.  I don't know why I didn't let you know at work! But you always\r\nthink you can get over an illness without staying at home.  Please,\r\ndon't make my parents suffer! There's no basis for any of the\r\naccusations you're making; nobody's ever said a word to me about any\r\nof these things.  Maybe you haven't read the latest contracts I sent\r\nin.  I'll set off with the eight o'clock train, as well, these few\r\nhours of rest have given me strength.  You don't need to wait, sir;\r\nI'll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as to\r\ntell that to the boss and recommend me to him!\"\r\n\r\nAnd while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was\r\nsaying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers - this was\r\neasily done, probably because of the practise he had already had in\r\nbed - where he now tried to get himself upright.  He really did want\r\nto open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speak\r\nwith the chief clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was\r\ncurious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him.\r\nIf they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor's\r\nresponsibility and he could rest.  If, however, they took everything\r\ncalmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried\r\nhe really could be at the station for eight o'clock.  The first few\r\ntimes he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just\r\nslid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing and\r\nstood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain\r\nbut he no longer gave any attention to it.  Now he let himself fall\r\nagainst the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of\r\nit with his little legs.  By now he had also calmed down, and kept\r\nquiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.\r\n\r\n\"Did you understand a word of all that?\" the chief clerk asked his\r\nparents, \"surely he's not trying to make fools of us\". \"Oh, God!\"\r\ncalled his mother, who was already in tears, \"he could be seriously\r\nill and we're making him suffer.  Grete! Grete!\" she then cried.\r\n\"Mother?\" his sister called from the other side.  They communicated\r\nacross Gregor's room.  \"You'll have to go for the doctor straight\r\naway.  Gregor is ill.  Quick, get the doctor.  Did you hear the way\r\nGregor spoke just now?\"  \"That was the voice of an animal\", said the\r\nchief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother's\r\nscreams.  \"Anna! Anna!\" his father called into the kitchen through\r\nthe entrance hall, clapping his hands, \"get a locksmith here, now!\"\r\nAnd the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out\r\nthrough the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they\r\nwent.  How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There\r\nwas no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it\r\nopen;  people often do in homes where something awful has happened.\r\n\r\nGregor, in contrast, had become much calmer.  So they couldn't\r\nunderstand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to\r\nhim, clearer than before - perhaps his ears had become used to the\r\nsound.  They had realised, though, that there was something wrong\r\nwith him, and were ready to help.  The first response to his\r\nsituation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel\r\nbetter.  He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and\r\nfrom the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising\r\nachievements - although he did not really distinguish one from the\r\nother.  Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to\r\nmake his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a little, but taking\r\ncare to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound\r\ndifferent from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure\r\nhe could judge this for himself.  Meanwhile, it had become very\r\nquiet in the next room.  Perhaps his parents were sat at the table\r\nwhispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed\r\nagainst the door and listening.\r\n\r\nGregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair.  Once\r\nthere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding\r\nhimself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his\r\nlegs.  He rested there a little while to recover from the effort\r\ninvolved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the\r\nlock with his mouth.  He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper\r\nteeth - how was he, then, to grasp the key? - but the lack of teeth\r\nwas, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw,\r\nhe really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that\r\nhe must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came\r\nfrom his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor.\r\n\"Listen\", said the chief clerk in the next room, \"he's turning the\r\nkey.\"  Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should\r\nhave been calling to him, his father and his mother too: \"Well done,\r\nGregor\", they should have cried, \"keep at it, keep hold of the\r\nlock!\"  And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his\r\nefforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying no\r\nattention to the pain he was causing himself.  As the key turned\r\nround he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself\r\nupright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down\r\nagain with the whole weight of his body as needed.  The clear sound\r\nof the lock as it snapped back was Gregor's sign that he could break\r\nhis concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself:\r\n\"So, I didn't need the locksmith after all\". Then he lay his head on\r\nthe handle of the door to open it completely.\r\n\r\nBecause he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide\r\nopen before he could be seen.  He had first to slowly turn himself\r\naround one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully\r\nif he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the\r\nroom.  He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to\r\npay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk\r\nexclaim a loud \"Oh!\", which sounded like the soughing of the wind.\r\nNow he also saw him - he was the nearest to the door - his hand\r\npressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by\r\na steady and invisible force.  Gregor's mother, her hair still\r\ndishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there, looked\r\nat his father.  Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward\r\ntowards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that\r\nspread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto\r\nher breast.  His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if\r\nwanting to knock Gregor back into his room.  Then he looked\r\nuncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands\r\nand wept so that his powerful chest shook.\r\n\r\nSo Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of\r\nthe other door which was still held bolted in place.  In this way\r\nonly half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it\r\nwhich he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others.\r\nMeanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless,\r\ngrey-black building on the other side of the street - which was a\r\nhospital - could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular\r\nline of windows piercing its facade; the rain was still\r\nfalling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the\r\nground one at a time.  The washing up from breakfast lay on the\r\ntable; there was so much of it because, for Gregor's father,\r\nbreakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would\r\nstretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of\r\ndifferent newspapers.  On the wall exactly opposite there was\r\nphotograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword\r\nin his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth\r\nrespect for his uniform and bearing.  The door to the entrance hall\r\nwas open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could\r\nsee onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then\", said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to\r\nhave kept calm, \"I'll get dressed straight away now, pack up my\r\nsamples and set off.  Will you please just let me leave? You can\r\nsee\", he said to the chief clerk, \"that I'm not stubborn and I\r\nlike to do my job; being a commercial traveller is arduous but\r\nwithout travelling I couldn't earn my living.  So where are you\r\ngoing, in to the office? Yes? Will you report everything accurately,\r\nthen? It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to\r\nwork, but that's just the right time to remember what's been\r\nachieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty\r\nhas been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligence\r\nand concentration.  You're well aware that I'm seriously in debt to\r\nour employer as well as having to look after my parents and my\r\nsister, so that I'm trapped in a difficult situation, but I will\r\nwork my way out of it again.  Please don't make things any harder\r\nfor me than they are already, and don't take sides against me at the\r\noffice.  I know that nobody likes the travellers.  They think we\r\nearn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it.  That's\r\njust prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of\r\nit.  But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the\r\nstaff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview\r\nthan the boss himself - it's very easy for a businessman like him to\r\nmake mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than\r\nhe should.  And you're also well aware that we travellers spend\r\nalmost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very\r\neasily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints,\r\nand it's almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of\r\nthing, we don't usually even hear about them, or if at all it's when\r\nwe arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that's when we feel\r\nthe harmful effects of what's been going on without even knowing\r\nwhat caused them.  Please, don't go away, at least first say\r\nsomething to show that you grant that I'm at least partly right!\"\r\n\r\nBut the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to\r\nspeak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his\r\ntrembling shoulders as he left.  He did not keep still for a moment\r\nwhile Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door\r\nwithout taking his eyes off him.  He moved very gradually, as if\r\nthere had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room.  It was\r\nonly when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden\r\nmovement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward in\r\na panic.  In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towards\r\nthe stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force\r\nwaiting to save him.\r\n\r\nGregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief\r\nclerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be\r\nput into extreme danger.  That was something his parents did not\r\nunderstand very well; over the years, they had become convinced that\r\nthis job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides,\r\nthey had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight\r\nof any thought for the future.  Gregor, though, did think about the\r\nfuture.  The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced\r\nand finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended\r\non it! If only his sister were here! She was clever; she was already\r\nin tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back.  And\r\nthe chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him;\r\nshe would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out\r\nof his shocked state.  But his sister was not there, Gregor would\r\nhave to do the job himself.  And without considering that he still\r\nwas not familiar with how well he could move about in his present\r\nstate, or that his speech still might not - or probably would not -\r\nbe understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through the\r\nopening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,\r\nridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but\r\nGregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought\r\nsomething to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs.  Hardly\r\nhad that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to\r\nfeel alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground\r\nunder them; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they\r\nwere even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and\r\nhe was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at\r\nan end.  He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side\r\nas he crouched there on the floor.  His mother was not far away in\r\nfront of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but\r\nthen she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her\r\nfingers spread shouting: \"Help, for pity's sake, Help!\"  The way she\r\nheld her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the\r\nunthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not;\r\nshe had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the\r\nbreakfast things on it; when she reached the table she sat quickly\r\ndown on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seeming\r\nto notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of\r\ncoffee was pouring down onto the carpet.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, mother\", said Gregor gently, looking up at her.  He had\r\ncompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not\r\nhelp himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the\r\nflow of coffee.  That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from\r\nthe table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her.\r\nGregor, though, had no time to spare for his parents now; the chief\r\nclerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister,\r\nhe looked back for the last time.  Gregor made a run for him; he\r\nwanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have\r\nexpected something, as he leapt down several steps at once and\r\ndisappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase.  The\r\nflight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor's\r\nfather into a panic as well.  Until then he had been relatively self\r\ncontrolled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerk\r\nhimself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him,\r\nGregor's father seized the chief clerk's stick in his right hand\r\n(the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hat\r\nand overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with his\r\nleft, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping his\r\nfoot at him as he went.  Gregor's appeals to his father were of no\r\nhelp, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly\r\nturned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.\r\nAcross the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor's mother had\r\npulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to\r\nher face.  A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards\r\nthe stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table\r\nfluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor.  Nothing would\r\nstop Gregor's father as he drove him back, making hissing noises at\r\nhim like a wild man.  Gregor had never had any practice in moving\r\nbackwards and was only able to go very slowly.  If Gregor had only\r\nbeen allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room\r\nstraight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that\r\nhis father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a\r\nlethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father's hand\r\nany moment.  Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no\r\nchoice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable of\r\ngoing backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as\r\npossible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn\r\nhimself round.  It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able\r\nto see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact\r\nnow and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a\r\ndistance as to which way to turn.  If only his father would stop\r\nthat unbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused.  When\r\nhe had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that\r\nhissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way\r\nhe had just come.  He was pleased when he finally had his head in\r\nfront of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his\r\nbody was too broad to get through it without further difficulty.  In\r\nhis present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open\r\nthe other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough space\r\nto get through.  He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should\r\nbe got back into his room as quickly as possible.  Nor would he ever\r\nhave allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation\r\nfor getting through the doorway.  What he did, making more noise\r\nthan ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there\r\nhad been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was\r\nnow more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant\r\nexperience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without\r\nregard for what might happen.  One side of his body lifted itself,\r\nhe lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white\r\ndoor and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,\r\nsoon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all\r\nby himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air\r\nwhile those on the other side were pressed painfully against the\r\nground.  Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which\r\nreleased him from where he was held and sent him flying, and heavily\r\nbleeding, deep into his room.  The door was slammed shut with the\r\nstick, then, finally, all was quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke\r\nfrom his deep and coma-like sleep.  He would have woken soon\r\nafterwards anyway even if he hadn't been disturbed, as he had had\r\nenough sleep and felt fully rested.  But he had the impression that\r\nsome hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front\r\nroom being carefully shut had woken him.  The light from the\r\nelectric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling\r\nand tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it was\r\ndark.  He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily\r\nwith his antennae - of which he was now beginning to learn the value\r\n- in order to see what had been happening there.  The whole of his\r\nleft side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar,  and he limped\r\nbadly on his two rows of legs.  One of the legs had been badly\r\ninjured in the events of that morning - it was nearly a miracle that\r\nonly one of them had been - and dragged along lifelessly.\r\n\r\nIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it\r\nactually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of\r\nsomething to eat.  By the door there was a dish filled with\r\nsweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it.  He\r\nwas so pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he\r\nhad been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the\r\nmilk, nearly covering his eyes with it.  But he soon drew his head\r\nback again in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender\r\nleft side make it difficult to eat the food - he was only able to\r\neat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole - but the\r\nmilk did not taste at all nice.  Milk like this was normally his\r\nfavourite drink, and his sister had certainly left it there for him\r\nbecause of that, but he turned, almost against his own will, away\r\nfrom the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.\r\n\r\nThrough the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had\r\nbeen lit in the living room.  His father at this time would normally\r\nbe sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to\r\nGregor's mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not\r\na sound to be heard.  Gregor's sister would often write and tell him\r\nabout this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in\r\nrecent times.  It was so quiet all around too, even though there\r\nmust have been somebody in the flat.  \"What a quiet life it is the\r\nfamily lead\", said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness,\r\nfelt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in\r\nsuch a nice home for his sister and parents.  But what now, if all\r\nthis peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and\r\nfrightening end? That was something that Gregor did not want to\r\nthink about too much, so he started to move about, crawling up and\r\ndown the room.\r\n\r\nOnce during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was\r\nopened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door\r\non the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to\r\nenter the room but thought better of it.  Gregor went and waited\r\nimmediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous\r\nvisitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it\r\nwas; but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in\r\nvain.  The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had\r\nwanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had opened up\r\none of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time\r\nduring the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides.\r\n\r\nIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room\r\nwas put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had\r\nstayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as\r\nthey went away together on tip-toe.  It was clear that no-one would\r\ncome into Gregor's room any more until morning; that gave him plenty\r\nof time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange\r\nhis life.  For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced\r\nto remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor,\r\neven though he had been living in it for five years.  Hardly aware\r\nof what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, he\r\nhurried under the couch.  It pressed down on his back a little, and\r\nhe was no longer able to lift his head, but he nonetheless felt\r\nimmediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too\r\nbroad to get it all underneath.\r\n\r\nHe spent the whole night there.  Some of the time he passed in a\r\nlight sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of\r\nhis hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague\r\nhopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the\r\ntime being he must remain calm, he must show patience and the\r\ngreatest consideration so that his family could bear the\r\nunpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced to\r\nimpose on them.\r\n\r\nGregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his\r\ndecisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had\r\nended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the\r\nfront room and looked anxiously in.  She did not see him straight\r\naway, but when she did notice him under the couch - he had to be\r\nsomewhere, for God's sake, he couldn't have flown away - she was so\r\nshocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut\r\nagain from outside.  But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as she\r\nopened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if\r\nentering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger.\r\nGregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch,\r\nand watched her.  Would she notice that he had left the milk as it\r\nwas, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him\r\nin some other food that was more suitable? If she didn't do it\r\nherself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,\r\nalthough he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the\r\ncouch, throw himself at his sister's feet and beg her for something\r\ngood to eat.  However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately\r\nand looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with\r\nsome surprise.  She immediately picked it up - using a rag,\r\nnot her bare hands - and carried it out.  Gregor was extremely\r\ncurious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the\r\nwildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his\r\nsister, in her goodness, actually did bring.  In order to test his\r\ntaste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread out\r\non an old newspaper.  There were old, half-rotten vegetables; bones\r\nfrom the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a\r\nfew raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declared\r\ninedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with\r\nbutter and salt.  As well as all that she had poured some water into\r\nthe dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor's\r\nuse, and placed it beside them.  Then, out of consideration for\r\nGregor's feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of\r\nher, she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so\r\nthat Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for\r\nhimself as he liked.  Gregor's little legs whirred, at last he could\r\neat.  What's more, his injuries must already have completely healed\r\nas he found no difficulty in moving.  This amazed him, as more than\r\na month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he\r\nthought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday.\r\n\"Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?\", he thought, and was\r\nalready sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost\r\ncompellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on the\r\nnewspaper.  Quickly one after another, his eyes watering with\r\npleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce; the\r\nfresh foods, on the other hand, he didn't like at all, and even\r\ndragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them\r\nbecause he couldn't stand the smell.  Long after he had finished\r\neating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turned\r\nthe key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw.  He\r\nwas immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he\r\nhurried back under the couch.  But he needed great self-control to\r\nstay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room,\r\nas eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he\r\ncould hardly breathe in that narrow space.  Half suffocating, he\r\nwatched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a\r\nbroom and swept up the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he\r\nhad not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more.\r\nShe quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden\r\nlid, and carried everything out.  She had hardly turned her back\r\nbefore Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThis was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the\r\nmorning while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the\r\nsecond time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his\r\nparents would sleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor's\r\nsister would send the maid away on some errand.  Gregor's father and\r\nmother certainly did not want him to starve either, but perhaps it\r\nwould have been more than they could stand to have any more\r\nexperience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his\r\nsister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were\r\nindeed suffering enough.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the\r\ndoctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the\r\nflat.  As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister,\r\nthought that he could understand them, so he had to be content to\r\nhear his sister's sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about\r\nhis room.  It was only later, when she had become a little more used\r\nto everything - there was, of course, no question of her ever\r\nbecoming fully used to the situation - that Gregor would sometimes\r\ncatch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be\r\nconstrued as friendly.  \"He's enjoyed his dinner today\", she might\r\nsay when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him,\r\nor if he left most of it, which slowly became more and more\r\nfrequent, she would often say, sadly, \"now everything's just been\r\nleft there again\".\r\n\r\nAlthough Gregor wasn't able to hear any news directly he did listen\r\nto much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard\r\nanyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and\r\npress his whole body against it.  There was seldom any conversation,\r\nespecially at first, that was not about him in some way, even if\r\nonly in secret.  For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime\r\nwas about what they should do now; but even between meals they spoke\r\nabout the same subject as there were always at least two members of\r\nthe family at home - nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and\r\nit was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty.  And on\r\nthe very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged\r\nGregor's mother to let her go without delay.  It was not very clear\r\nhow much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter\r\nof an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor's mother for her dismissal as\r\nif she had done her an enormous service.  She even swore\r\nemphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had\r\nhappened, even though no-one had asked that of her.\r\n\r\nNow Gregor's sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;\r\nalthough that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much.\r\nGregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another\r\nto eat, and receive no more answer than \"no thanks, I've had enough\"\r\nor something similar.  No-one drank very much either.  His sister\r\nwould sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping\r\nfor the chance to go and fetch it herself.  When his father then\r\nsaid nothing she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that\r\nshe could send the housekeeper for it, but then his father would\r\nclose the matter with a big, loud \"No\", and no more would be said.\r\n\r\nEven before the first day had come to an end, his father had\r\nexplained to Gregor's mother and sister what their finances and\r\nprospects were.  Now and then he stood up from the table and took\r\nsome receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from\r\nhis business when it had collapsed five years earlier.  Gregor heard\r\nhow he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he\r\nhad taken the item he wanted.  What he heard his father say was some\r\nof the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been\r\nincarcerated in his room.  He had thought that nothing at all\r\nremained from his father's business, at least he had never told him\r\nanything different, and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway.\r\nTheir business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total\r\ndespair, and Gregor's only concern at that time had been to arrange\r\nthings so that they could all forget about it as quickly as\r\npossible.  So then he started working especially hard, with a fiery\r\nvigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling\r\nrepresentative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn\r\nmoney in quite different ways.  Gregor converted his success at work\r\nstraight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the\r\nbenefit of his astonished and delighted family.  They had been good\r\ntimes and they had never come again, at least not with the same\r\nsplendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was\r\nin a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear\r\nthem.  They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family,\r\nthey took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it,\r\nalthough there was no longer much warm affection given in return.\r\nGregor only remained close to his sister now.  Unlike him, she was\r\nvery fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was his\r\nsecret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it\r\nwould cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some\r\nother way.  During Gregor's short periods in town, conversation with\r\nhis sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever\r\nmentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised.  Their\r\nparents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought\r\nabout it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he\r\nplanned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.\r\n\r\nThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his\r\nmind in his present state, pressed upright against the door and\r\nlistening.  There were times when he simply became too tired to\r\ncontinue listening, when his head would fall wearily against the\r\ndoor and he would pull it up again with a start, as even the\r\nslightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would\r\nall go silent.  \"What's that he's doing now\", his father would say\r\nafter a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then\r\nwould the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.\r\n\r\nWhen explaining things, his father repeated himself several times,\r\npartly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with\r\nthese matters himself and partly because Gregor's mother did not\r\nunderstand everything the first time.  From these repeated explanations\r\nGregor learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes\r\nthere was still some money available from the old days.  It was not\r\na lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest\r\nhad accumulated.  Besides that, they had not been using up all the\r\nmoney that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping only a\r\nlittle for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating.\r\nBehind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at\r\nthis unexpected thrift and caution.  He could actually have used\r\nthis surplus money to reduce his father's debt to his boss, and the\r\nday when he could have freed himself from that job would have come\r\nmuch closer, but now it was certainly better the way his father had\r\ndone things.\r\n\r\nThis money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family\r\nto live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for,\r\nperhaps, one or two years, no more.  That's to say, it was money\r\nthat should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies;\r\nmoney to live on had to be earned.  His father was healthy but old,\r\nand lacking in self confidence.  During the five years that he had\r\nnot been working - the first holiday in a life that had been full of\r\nstrain and no success - he had put on a lot of weight and become\r\nvery slow and clumsy.  Would Gregor's elderly mother now have to go\r\nand earn money? She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her\r\njust to move about the home, every other day would be spent\r\nstruggling for breath on the sofa by the open window.  Would his\r\nsister have to go and earn money? She was still a child of\r\nseventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting\r\nof wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business,\r\njoining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the\r\nviolin.  Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money,\r\nGregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself\r\nonto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot with\r\nshame and regret.\r\n\r\nHe would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a\r\nwink but scratching at the leather for hours on end.  Or he might go\r\nto all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto\r\nthe sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to\r\nstare out of it.  He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from\r\ndoing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered\r\nthan experienced,  as what he actually saw in this way was becoming\r\nless distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he had\r\nused to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the\r\nstreet, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had not known\r\nthat he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite\r\nbeing in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he was\r\nlooking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the\r\ngrey earth mingled inseparably.  His observant sister only needed to\r\nnotice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its\r\nexact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and\r\neven left the inner pane of the window open from then on.\r\n\r\nIf Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her\r\nfor all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him\r\nto bear it; but as it was it caused him pain.  His sister,\r\nnaturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing\r\nburdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, the\r\nbetter she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also\r\nable to see through it all so much better.  It had even become very\r\nunpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room.  No sooner\r\nhad she come in than she would quickly close the door as a\r\nprecaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into\r\nGregor's room, then she would go straight to the window and pull it\r\nhurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating.  Even if it was\r\ncold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little\r\nwhile.  She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about\r\nand noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole\r\nwhile, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to\r\nspare him this ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the\r\nsame room with him with the windows closed.\r\n\r\nOne day, about a month after Gregor's transformation when his sister\r\nno longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance,\r\nshe came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him\r\nstill staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be\r\nmost horrible.  In itself, his sister's not coming into the room\r\nwould have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been\r\ndifficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still\r\nthere, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back and\r\nclosed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he had\r\nthreatened her and tried to bite her.  Gregor went straight to hide\r\nhimself under the couch, of course, but he had to wait until midday\r\nbefore his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than\r\nusual.  It made him realise that she still found his appearance\r\nunbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had to\r\novercome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that\r\nprotruded from under the couch.  One day, in order to spare her even\r\nthis sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the\r\ncouch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered\r\nand his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down.\r\nIf she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do\r\nwas take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no\r\npleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely.  She left the\r\nsheet where it was.  Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of\r\ngratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet\r\nto see how his sister liked the new arrangement.\r\n\r\nFor the first fourteen days, Gregor's parents could not bring\r\nthemselves to come into the room to see him.  He would often hear\r\nthem say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing\r\neven though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat\r\nuseless and frequently been annoyed with her.  But now the two of\r\nthem, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of\r\nGregor's room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as\r\nshe went out again she would have to tell them exactly how\r\neverything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this\r\ntime and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen.\r\nHis mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but\r\nhis father and sister at first persuaded her against it.  Gregor\r\nlistened very closely to all this, and approved fully.  Later,\r\nthough, she had to be held back by force, which made her call out:\r\n\"Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son! Can't you\r\nunderstand I have to see him?\", and Gregor would think to himself\r\nthat maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every day\r\nof course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand\r\neverything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was\r\nstill just a child after all, and really might not have had an\r\nadult's appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.\r\n\r\nGregor's wish to see his mother was soon realised.  Out of\r\nconsideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at\r\nthe window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did\r\nnot give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just lie\r\nquietly through the night, his food soon stopped giving him any\r\npleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the habit\r\nof crawling up and down the walls and ceiling.  He was especially\r\nfond of hanging from the ceiling; it was quite different from lying\r\non the floor; he could breathe more freely; his body had a light\r\nswing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost happy, it might happen\r\nthat he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and\r\nlanding on the floor with a crash.  But now, of course, he had far\r\nbetter control of his body than before and, even with a fall as\r\ngreat as that, caused himself no damage.  Very soon his sister\r\nnoticed Gregor's new way of entertaining himself - he had, after\r\nall, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about -\r\nand got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by\r\nremoving the furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of\r\ndrawers and the desk.  Now, this was not something that she would be\r\nable to do by herself; she did not dare to ask for help from her\r\nfather; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the\r\ncook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she\r\nhad even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times\r\nand never to have to open the door unless it was especially\r\nimportant; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when\r\nGregor's father was not there and fetch his mother to help her.  As\r\nshe approached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express her\r\njoy, but once at the door she went silent.  First, of course, his\r\nsister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room\r\nwas alright; and only then did she let her mother enter.  Gregor had\r\nhurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more\r\nfolds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just\r\nbeen thrown down by chance.  Gregor also refrained, this time, from\r\nspying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see his\r\nmother until later and was simply glad that she had come.  \"You can\r\ncome in, he can't be seen\", said his sister, obviously leading her\r\nin by the hand.  The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair\r\nof feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they\r\npushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest\r\npart of the work for herself and ignoring her mother's warnings that\r\nshe would strain herself.  This lasted a very long time.  After\r\nlabouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would\r\nbe better to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was too\r\nheavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor's father got\r\nhome and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way\r\neven more, and for another thing it wasn't even sure that taking the\r\nfurniture away would really be any help to him.  She thought just\r\nthe opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her\r\nheart; and why wouldn't Gregor feel the same way about it, he'd been\r\nused to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make\r\nhim feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that.  Then, quietly,\r\nalmost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she did\r\nnot know) to hear not even the tone of her voice, as she was\r\nconvinced that he did not understand her words, she added \"and by\r\ntaking the furniture away, won't it seem like we're showing that\r\nwe've given up all hope of improvement and we're abandoning him to\r\ncope for himself? I think it'd be best to leave the room exactly the\r\nway it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he'll\r\nfind everything unchanged and he'll be able to forget the time in\r\nbetween all the easier\".\r\n\r\nHearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the\r\nlack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous\r\nlife led by the family during these two months, must have made him\r\nconfused - he could think of no other way of explaining to himself\r\nwhy he had seriously wanted his room emptied out.  Had he really\r\nwanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out\r\nwith the nice furniture he had inherited? That would have let him\r\ncrawl around unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let\r\nhim quickly forget his past when he had still been human.  He had\r\ncome very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his\r\nmother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it.  Nothing\r\nshould be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do without\r\nthe good influence the furniture had on his condition; and if the\r\nfurniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that\r\nwas not a loss but a great advantage.\r\n\r\nHis sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the\r\nidea, not without reason, that she was Gregor's spokesman to his\r\nparents about the things that concerned him.  This meant that his\r\nmother's advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on\r\nremoving not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had\r\nthought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important\r\ncouch.  It was more than childish perversity, of course, or the\r\nunexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made her\r\ninsist; she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to\r\ncrawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see,\r\nwas of no use to him at all.  Girls of that age, though, do become\r\nenthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever\r\nthey can.  Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor's\r\nsituation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do\r\neven more for him.  Grete would probably be the only one who would\r\ndare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls\r\nby himself.\r\n\r\nSo she refused to let her mother dissuade her.  Gregor's mother\r\nalready looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and\r\nhelped Gregor's sister to get the chest of drawers out with what\r\nstrength she had.  The chest of drawers was something that Gregor\r\ncould do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay.\r\nHardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out\r\nof the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch to\r\nsee what he could do about it.  He meant to be as careful and\r\nconsiderate as he could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother who\r\ncame back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round the\r\nchest, pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself\r\nwithout, of course, moving it an inch.  His mother was not used to\r\nthe sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so Gregor hurried\r\nbackwards to the far end of the couch.  In his startlement, though,\r\nhe was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a\r\nlittle.  It was enough to attract his mother's attention.  She stood\r\nvery still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to\r\nGrete.\r\n\r\nGregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was\r\nhappening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after\r\nall, but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their\r\nlittle calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the\r\nfloor, all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed\r\nfrom all sides.  With his head and legs pulled in against him and\r\nhis body pressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himself\r\nthat he could not stand all of this much longer.  They were emptying\r\nhis room out; taking away everything that was dear to him; they had\r\nalready taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools;\r\nnow they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place\r\nclearly worn into the floor, the desk where he had done his homework\r\nas a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at\r\ninfant school--he really could not wait any longer to see whether\r\nthe two women's intentions were good.  He had nearly forgotten they\r\nwere there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything while\r\nthey worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped\r\nheavily on the floor.\r\n\r\nSo, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room\r\ncatching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times\r\nnot knowing what he should save first before his attention was\r\nsuddenly caught by the picture on the wall - which was already\r\ndenuded of everything else that had been on it - of the lady dressed\r\nin copious fur.  He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself\r\nagainst its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot\r\nbelly.  This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would\r\ncertainly be taken away by no-one.  He turned his head to face the\r\ndoor into the living room so that he could watch the women when they\r\ncame back.\r\n\r\nThey had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite\r\nsoon; Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly\r\ncarrying her.  \"What shall we take now, then?\", said Grete and\r\nlooked around.  Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall.  Perhaps\r\nonly because her mother was there, she remained calm, bent her face\r\nto her so that she would not look round and said, albeit hurriedly\r\nand with a tremor in her voice: \"Come on, let's go back in the\r\nliving room for a while?\"  Gregor could see what Grete had in mind,\r\nshe wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down\r\nfrom the wall.  Well, she could certainly try it! He sat unyielding\r\non his picture.  He would rather jump at Grete's face.\r\n\r\nBut Grete's words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to\r\none side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the\r\nwallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw\r\nscreamed: \"Oh God, oh God!\"  Arms outstretched, she fell onto the\r\ncouch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile.\r\n\"Gregor!\" shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist.\r\n That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his\r\ntransformation.  She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of\r\nsmelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted\r\nto help too - he could save his picture later, although he stuck\r\nfast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he,\r\ntoo, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in\r\nthe old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; she\r\nwas looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turned\r\nround; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut\r\nGregor's face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him;\r\nnow, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles\r\nshe could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the door\r\nshut with her foot.  So now Gregor was shut out from his mother,\r\nwho, because of him, might be near to death; he could not open the\r\ndoor if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had to\r\nstay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and,\r\noppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,\r\nhe crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally\r\nin his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell\r\ndown into the middle of the dinner table.\r\n\r\nHe lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was\r\nquiet, maybe that was a good sign.  Then there was someone at the\r\ndoor.  The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so\r\nthat Grete would have to go and answer it.  His father had arrived\r\nhome.  \"What's happened?\" were his first words; Grete's appearance\r\nmust have made everything clear to him.  She answered him with\r\nsubdued voice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: \"Mother's\r\nfainted, but she's better now.  Gregor got out.\"  \"Just as I\r\nexpected\", said his father, \"just as I always said, but you women\r\nwouldn't listen, would you.\"  It was clear to Gregor that Grete had\r\nnot said enough and that his father took it to mean that something\r\nbad had happened, that he was responsible for some act of violence.\r\nThat meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he\r\ndid not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been\r\npossible.  So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself\r\nagainst it so that his father, when he came in from the hall, could\r\nsee straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would go\r\nback into his room without delay, that it would not be necessary to\r\ndrive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nHis father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like\r\nthat; \"Ah!\", he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both\r\nangry and glad at the same time.  Gregor drew his head back from the\r\ndoor and lifted it towards his father.  He really had not imagined\r\nhis father the way he stood there now; of late, with his new habit\r\nof crawling about, he had neglected to pay attention to what was\r\ngoing on the rest of the flat the way he had done before.  He really\r\nought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, was\r\nthat really his father? The same tired man as used to be laying\r\nthere entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business\r\ntrips, who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his\r\nnightgown when he came back in the evenings; who was hardly even\r\nable to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raise\r\nhis arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they went for a\r\nwalk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in\r\nhis overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labour his\r\nway forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking\r\nslowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully and,\r\nif he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his\r\ncompanions around him.  He was standing up straight enough now;\r\ndressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by\r\nthe employees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar\r\nof the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy\r\neyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his\r\nnormally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his\r\nscalp.  He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some\r\nbank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa,\r\nput his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his\r\nlong uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards\r\nGregor.  He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind,\r\nbut nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high.  Gregor was amazed\r\nat the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time\r\nwith that - he knew full well, right from the first day of his new\r\nlife, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely\r\nstrict with him.  And so he ran up to his father, stopped when his\r\nfather stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, even\r\nslightly.  In this way they went round the room several times\r\nwithout anything decisive happening, without even giving the\r\nimpression of a chase as everything went so slowly.  Gregor remained\r\nall this time on the floor, largely because he feared his father\r\nmight see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or\r\nceiling.  Whatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly\r\nwould not be able to keep up this running about for long, as for\r\neach step his father took he had to carry out countless movements.\r\nHe became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life his\r\nlungs had not been very reliable.  Now, as he lurched about in his\r\nefforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could\r\nhardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too slow for him to\r\nthink of any other way of saving himself than running; he almost\r\nforgot that the walls were there for him to use although, here, they\r\nwere concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and\r\nprotrusions - then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flew\r\ndown and rolled in front of him.  It was an apple; then another one\r\nimmediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no longer\r\nany point in running as his father had decided to bombard him.  He\r\nhad filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and\r\nnow, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple\r\nafter another.  These little, red apples rolled about on the floor,\r\nknocking into each other as if they had electric motors.  An apple\r\nthrown without much force glanced against Gregor's back and slid off\r\nwithout doing any harm.  Another one however, immediately following\r\nit, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag\r\nhimself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible\r\npain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot\r\nand spread himself out, all his senses in confusion.  The last thing\r\nhe saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister was\r\nscreaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his\r\nsister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to\r\nmake it easier for her to breathe), she ran to his father, her\r\nskirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground,\r\nstumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father, her arms\r\naround him, uniting herself with him totally - now Gregor lost his\r\nability to see anything - her hands behind his father's head begging\r\nhim to spare Gregor's life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNo-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor's flesh, so it\r\nremained there as a visible reminder of his injury.  He had suffered\r\nit there for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious\r\nenough to remind even his father that Gregor, despite his current\r\nsad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated\r\nas an enemy.  On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to\r\nswallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.\r\n\r\nBecause of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility -\r\nprobably permanently.  He had been reduced to the condition of an\r\nancient invalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl across\r\nhis room - crawling over the ceiling was out of the question - but\r\nthis deterioration in his condition was fully (in his opinion) made\r\nup for by the door to the living room being left open every evening.\r\n He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours\r\nbefore it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his room\r\nwhere he could not be seen from the living room, he could watch the\r\nfamily in the light of the dinner table and listen to their\r\nconversation - with everyone's permission, in a way, and thus quite\r\ndifferently from before.\r\n\r\nThey no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of\r\ncourse, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when\r\nhe was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room.\r\n All of them were usually very quiet nowadays.  Soon after dinner,\r\nhis father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister\r\nwould urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the\r\nlamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who\r\nhad taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings\r\nso that she might be able to get a better position later on.\r\nSometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor's mother\r\n\"you're doing so much sewing again today!\", as if he did not know\r\nthat he had been dozing - and then he would go back to sleep again\r\nwhile mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.\r\n\r\nWith a kind of stubbornness, Gregor's father refused to take his\r\nuniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg\r\nGregor's father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if\r\nalways ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his\r\nsuperior even here.  The uniform had not been new to start with, but\r\nas a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the\r\nefforts of Gregor's mother and sister to look after it.  Gregor\r\nwould often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on\r\nthis coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny,\r\nwhile the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but\r\npeaceful.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it struck ten, Gregor's mother would speak gently to his\r\nfather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he\r\ncouldn't sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his\r\nsleep if he was to be up at six to get to work.  But since he had\r\nbeen in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on\r\nstaying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep\r\nand it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the\r\nchair for his bed.  Then, however much mother and sister would\r\nimportune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep\r\nslowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes\r\nclosed and refusing to get up.  Gregor's mother would tug at his\r\nsleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor's sister would\r\nleave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any effect\r\non him.  He would just sink deeper into his chair.  Only when the\r\ntwo women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes,\r\nlook at them one after the other and say: \"What a life! This is what\r\npeace I get in my old age!\"  And supported by the two women he would\r\nlift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load\r\nhimself, let the women take him to the door, send them off and carry\r\non by himself while Gregor's mother would throw down her needle and\r\nhis sister her pen so that they could run after his father and\r\ncontinue being of help to him.\r\n\r\nWho, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to\r\ngive more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The\r\nhousehold budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed;\r\nan enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped\r\naround her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest\r\nwork; everything else was looked after by Gregor's mother on top of\r\nthe large amount of sewing work she did.  Gregor even learned,\r\nlistening to the evening conversation about what price they had\r\nhoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family\r\nhad been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond\r\nof wearing them at functions and celebrations.  But the loudest\r\ncomplaint was that although the flat was much too big for their\r\npresent circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no\r\nimaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address.  He could\r\nsee quite well, though, that there were more reasons than\r\nconsideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it\r\nwould have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate\r\nwith a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back\r\nfrom their decision to move was much more to do with their total\r\ndespair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune\r\nunlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related\r\nto.  They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects\r\nfrom poor people, Gregor's father brought bank employees their\r\nbreakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for\r\nstrangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the\r\nbehest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength to\r\ndo any more.  And the injury in Gregor's back began to hurt as much\r\nas when it was new.  After they had come back from taking his father\r\nto bed Gregor's mother and sister would now leave their work where\r\nit was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother would\r\npoint to Gregor's room and say \"Close that door, Grete\", and then,\r\nwhen he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room and\r\ntheir tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring\r\ndry-eyed at the table.\r\n\r\nGregor hardly slept at all, either night or day.  Sometimes he would\r\nthink of taking over the family's affairs, just like before, the\r\nnext time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss\r\nand the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts,\r\nthe salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three\r\nfriends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a\r\nprovincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared\r\nagain, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been\r\nserious but too slow, - all of them appeared to him, mixed together\r\nwith strangers and others he had forgotten, but instead of helping\r\nhim and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he was\r\nglad when they disappeared.  Other times he was not at all in the\r\nmood to look after his family, he was filled with simple rage about\r\nthe lack of attention he was shown, and although he could think of\r\nnothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could get into\r\nthe pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to,\r\neven if he was not hungry.  Gregor's sister no longer thought about\r\nhow she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other\r\ninto his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the\r\nmorning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it away\r\nagain with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or\r\n- more often than not - had been left totally untouched.  She still\r\ncleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been\r\nany quicker about it.  Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here\r\nand there were little balls of dust and filth.  At first, Gregor\r\nwent into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived\r\nas a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks\r\nwithout his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt\r\nas well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it.\r\nAt the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for\r\nher and which everyone in the family understood - cleaning up\r\nGregor's room was for her and her alone.  Gregor's mother did once\r\nthoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of\r\nwater to do it - although that much dampness also made Gregor ill\r\nand he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile.  But his mother\r\nwas to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly had\r\nhis sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change\r\nin Gregor's room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living\r\nroom where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she\r\nbroke into convulsive tears.  Her father, of course, was startled\r\nout of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and\r\nhelpless; then they, too, became agitated; Gregor's father, standing\r\nto the right of his mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning\r\nof Gregor's room to his sister; from her left, Gregor's sister\r\nscreamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor's room again;\r\nwhile his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himself\r\nwith anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears,\r\nthumped on the table with her small fists; and Gregor hissed in\r\nanger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save him\r\nthe sight of this and all its noise.\r\n\r\nGregor's sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking\r\nafter Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but\r\neven so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place.\r\nGregor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected.  Now, though,\r\nthe charwoman was here.  This elderly widow, with a robust bone\r\nstructure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in\r\nher long life, wasn't really repelled by Gregor.  Just by chance one\r\nday, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor's\r\nroom and found herself face to face with him.  He was taken totally\r\nby surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro\r\nwhile she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in\r\nfront of her.  From then on she never failed to open the door\r\nslightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him.  At\r\nfirst she would call to him as she did so with words that she\r\nprobably considered friendly, such as \"come on then, you old\r\ndung-beetle!\", or \"look at the old dung-beetle there!\"  Gregor never\r\nresponded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where he\r\nwas without moving as if the door had never even been opened.  If\r\nonly they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day\r\ninstead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt\r\nlike it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the\r\nwindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to\r\nspeak to him in that way once again.  Gregor was so resentful of it\r\nthat he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it\r\nwas like a kind of attack.  Instead of being afraid, the charwoman\r\njust lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there\r\nwith her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until\r\nthe chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor's back.\r\n\"Aren't you coming any closer, then?\", she asked when Gregor turned\r\nround again, and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.\r\n\r\nGregor had almost entirely stopped eating.  Only if he happened to\r\nfind himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he\r\nmight take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there\r\na few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again.  At\r\nfirst he thought it was distress at the state of his room that\r\nstopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes made\r\nthere.  They had got into the habit of putting things into this room\r\nthat they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many\r\nsuch things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to\r\nthree gentlemen.  These earnest gentlemen - all three of them had\r\nfull beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door\r\none day - were painfully insistent on things' being tidy.  This\r\nmeant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room in\r\nthis establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the\r\nkitchen.  Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate,\r\nespecially if it was dirty.  They had moreover brought most of their\r\nown furnishings and equipment with them.  For this reason, many\r\nthings had become superfluous which, although they could not be\r\nsold, the family did not wish to discard.  All these things found\r\ntheir way into Gregor's room.  The dustbins from the kitchen found\r\ntheir way in there too.  The charwoman was always in a hurry, and\r\nanything she couldn't use for the time being she would just chuck in\r\nthere.  He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object\r\nand the hand that held it.  The woman most likely meant to fetch the\r\nthings back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to\r\nthrow everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that\r\nthey were left where they landed when they had first been thrown\r\nunless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere\r\nelse.  At first he moved it because, with no other room free where\r\nhe could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came to\r\nenjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to\r\ndeath and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening\r\nmeal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so\r\nthe door to this room was often kept closed in the evening.  But\r\nGregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after\r\nall, often failed to make use of it when it was open and, without\r\nthe family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest\r\ncorner.  One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living\r\nroom slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who\r\nrented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on.\r\nThey sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had taken his meals\r\nwith his father and mother, they unfolded the serviettes and picked\r\nup their knives and forks.  Gregor's mother immediately appeared in\r\nthe doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister\r\nwith a dish piled high with potatoes.  The food was steaming, and\r\nfilled the room with its smell.  The gentlemen bent over the dishes\r\nset in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before\r\neating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as\r\nan authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat\r\nwhile it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whether\r\nit was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the\r\nkitchen.  It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor's mother and\r\nsister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again\r\nand smiled.\r\n\r\nThe family themselves ate in the kitchen.  Nonetheless, Gregor's\r\nfather came into the living room before he went into the kitchen,\r\nbowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table.\r\nThe gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards.\r\n Then, once they were alone, they ate in near perfect silence.  It\r\nseemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of\r\neating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had\r\nwanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was\r\nnot possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless\r\nhowever nice they might be.  \"I'd like to eat something\", said\r\nGregor anxiously, \"but not anything like they're eating.  They do\r\nfeed themselves.  And here I am, dying!\"\r\n\r\nThroughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the\r\nviolin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the\r\nkitchen.  The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the\r\none in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of\r\nthe others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and\r\nsmoking.  When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood\r\nup and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they\r\nstood pressed against each other.  Someone must have heard them in\r\nthe kitchen, as Gregor's father called out: \"Is the playing perhaps\r\nunpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.\"  \"On\r\nthe contrary\", said the middle gentleman, \"would the young lady not\r\nlike to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after\r\nall, much more cosy and comfortable?\"  \"Oh yes, we'd love to\",\r\ncalled back Gregor's father as if he had been the violin player\r\nhimself.  The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited.\r\nGregor's father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother with\r\nthe music and his sister with the violin.  She calmly prepared\r\neverything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had never\r\nrented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated\r\ncourtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on\r\ntheir own chairs; his father leant against the door with his right\r\nhand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother,\r\nthough, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - leaving\r\nthe chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it - out of\r\nthe way in a corner.\r\n\r\nHis sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention,\r\none on each side, to the movements of her hands.  Drawn in by the\r\nplaying, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had\r\nhis head in the living room.  Before, he had taken great pride in\r\nhow considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had\r\nbecome so thoughtless about the others.  What's more, there was now\r\nall the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the\r\ndust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest\r\nmovement; he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on\r\nhis back and sides; he was much too indifferent to everything now to\r\nlay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to\r\ndo several times a day.  And despite this condition, he was not too\r\nshy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nNo-one noticed him, though.  The family was totally preoccupied with\r\nthe violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their\r\nhands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music\r\nstand to look at all the notes being played, and they must have\r\ndisturbed Gregor's sister, but soon, in contrast with the family,\r\nthey  withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking\r\nto each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window while\r\nGregor's father observed them anxiously.  It really now seemed very\r\nobvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or\r\nentertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that they had\r\nhad enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of\r\npoliteness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed.  It was\r\nespecially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from their\r\ncigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses.  Yet Gregor's sister\r\nwas playing so beautifully.  Her face was leant to one side,\r\nfollowing the lines of music with a careful and melancholy\r\nexpression.  Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his\r\nhead close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the\r\nchance came.  Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It\r\nseemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown\r\nnourishment he had been yearning for.  He was determined to make his\r\nway forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might\r\ncome into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her\r\nplaying here as much as he would.  He never wanted to let her out of\r\nhis room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearance\r\nshould, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at every\r\ndoor of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his\r\nsister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of\r\nher own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her\r\near bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to\r\nsend her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about\r\nit last Christmas - had Christmas really come and gone already? - if\r\nthis misfortune hadn't got in the way, and refuse to let anyone\r\ndissuade him from it.  On hearing all this, his sister would break\r\nout in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder\r\nand kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to work, she\r\nhad kept free without any necklace or collar.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Samsa!\", shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor's father,\r\npointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at\r\nGregor as he slowly moved forward.  The violin went silent, the\r\nmiddle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends,\r\nshaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor.  His father seemed\r\nto think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before\r\ndriving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and\r\nseemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing\r\nhad been.  He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and\r\nattempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as\r\ntrying to block their view of Gregor with his body.  Now they did\r\nbecome a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was his\r\nfather's behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that\r\nthey had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without\r\nknowing it.  They asked Gregor's father for explanations, raised\r\ntheir arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved\r\nback towards their room only very slowly.  Meanwhile Gregor's sister\r\nhad overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was\r\nsuddenly interrupted.  She had let her hands drop and let violin and\r\nbow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if\r\nstill playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay\r\nthe instrument on her mother's lap who still sat laboriously\r\nstruggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room\r\nwhich, under pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more\r\nquickly moving toward.  Under his sister's experienced hand, the\r\npillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and\r\nshe had already finished making the beds and slipped out again\r\nbefore the three gentlemen had reached the room.  Gregor's father\r\nseemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the\r\nrespect he owed to his tenants.  He urged them and pressed them\r\nuntil, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of\r\nthe three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and\r\nthereby brought Gregor's father to a halt.  \"I declare here and\r\nnow\", he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor's mother and\r\nsister to gain their attention too, \"that with regard to the\r\nrepugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family\"\r\n- here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor - \"I give\r\nimmediate notice on my room.  For the days that I have been living\r\nhere I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will\r\nconsider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages\r\nfrom you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the\r\ngrounds for such an action.\"  He was silent and looked straight\r\nahead as if waiting for something.  And indeed, his two friends\r\njoined in with the words: \"And we also give immediate notice.\"  With\r\nthat, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door.\r\n\r\nGregor's father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his\r\nhands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself\r\nout for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head\r\nkept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all.\r\nThroughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen\r\nhad first seen him.  His disappointment at the failure of his plan,\r\nand perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible\r\nfor him to move.  He was sure that everyone would turn on him any\r\nmoment, and he waited.  He was not even startled out of this state\r\nwhen the violin on his mother's lap fell from her trembling fingers\r\nand landed loudly on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Father, Mother\", said his sister, hitting the table with her hand\r\nas introduction, \"we can't carry on like this.  Maybe you can't see\r\nit, but I can.  I don't want to call this monster my brother, all I\r\ncan say is: we have to try and get rid of it.  We've done all that's\r\nhumanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don't think\r\nanyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's absolutely right\", said Gregor's father to himself.  His\r\nmother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to\r\ncough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged\r\nexpression in her eyes.\r\n\r\nGregor's sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her\r\nforehead.  Her words seemed to give Gregor's father some more\r\ndefinite ideas.  He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between\r\nthe plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and\r\noccasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile.\r\n\r\n\"We have to try and get rid of it\", said Gregor's sister, now\r\nspeaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with\r\ncoughing to listen, \"it'll be the death of both of you, I can see it\r\ncoming.  We can't all work as hard as we have to and then come home\r\nto be tortured like this, we can't endure it.  I can't endure it any\r\nmore.\"  And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down\r\nthe face of her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\n\"My child\", said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding,\r\n\"what are we to do?\"\r\n\r\nHis sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness\r\nand tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\n\"If he could just understand us\", said his father almost as a\r\nquestion; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as\r\na sign that of that there was no question.\r\n\r\n\"If he could just understand us\", repeated Gregor's father, closing\r\nhis eyes in acceptance of his sister's certainty that that was quite\r\nimpossible, \"then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement\r\nwith him.  But as it is ...\"\r\n\r\n\"It's got to go\", shouted his sister, \"that's the only way, Father.\r\nYou've got to get rid of the idea that that's Gregor.  We've only\r\nharmed ourselves by believing it for so long.  How can that be\r\nGregor? If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it's not\r\npossible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he\r\nwould have gone of his own free will.  We wouldn't have a brother\r\nany more, then, but we could carry on with our lives and remember\r\nhim with respect.  As it is this animal is persecuting us, it's\r\ndriven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the whole\r\nflat and force us to sleep on the streets.  Father, look, just\r\nlook\", she suddenly screamed, \"he's starting again!\"   In her alarm,\r\nwhich was totally beyond Gregor's comprehension, his sister even\r\nabandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her\r\nchair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay\r\nanywhere near Gregor.  She rushed over to behind her father, who had\r\nbecome excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his\r\nhands in front of Gregor's sister as if to protect her.\r\n\r\nBut Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all\r\nhis sister.  All he had done was begin to turn round so that he\r\ncould go back into his room, although that was in itself quite\r\nstartling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round\r\nrequired a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help\r\nhimself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the\r\nfloor.  He stopped and looked round.  They seemed to have realised\r\nhis good intention and had only been alarmed briefly.  Now they all\r\nlooked at him in unhappy silence.  His mother lay in her chair with\r\nher legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes\r\nnearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his father\r\nwith her arms around his neck.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe now they'll let me turn round\", thought Gregor and went back\r\nto work.  He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had\r\nsometimes to stop and take a rest.  No-one was making him rush any\r\nmore, everything was left up to him.  As soon as he had finally\r\nfinished turning round he began to move straight ahead.  He was\r\namazed at the great distance that separated him from his room, and\r\ncould not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak\r\nstate a little while before and almost without noticing it.  He\r\nconcentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that\r\nthere was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him.\r\nHe did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway.  He did\r\nnot turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff,\r\nbut it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had\r\nchanged, only his sister had stood up.  With his last glance he saw\r\nthat his mother had now fallen completely asleep.\r\n\r\nHe was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut,\r\nbolted and locked.  The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him\r\nthat his little legs collapsed under him.  It was his sister who had\r\nbeen in so much of a rush.  She had been standing there waiting and\r\nsprung forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and\r\nas she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents \"At\r\nlast!\".\r\n\r\n\"What now, then?\", Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the\r\ndarkness.  He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move\r\nat all.  This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being\r\nable to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then\r\nwas unnatural.  He also felt relatively comfortable.  It is true\r\nthat his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly\r\ngetting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether.\r\nHe could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the\r\ninflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust.\r\nHe thought back of his family with emotion and love.  If it was\r\npossible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his\r\nsister.  He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination\r\nuntil he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning.  He\r\nwatched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the\r\nwindow too.  Then, without his willing it, his head sank down\r\ncompletely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.\r\n\r\nWhen the cleaner came in early in the morning - they'd often asked\r\nher not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her\r\nhurry she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she'd\r\narrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace - she\r\nmade her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing\r\nspecial.  She thought he was laying there so still on purpose,\r\nplaying the martyr; she attributed all possible understanding to\r\nhim.  She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so she\r\ntried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway.  When she had no\r\nsuccess with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked\r\nat him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across\r\nthe floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention.\r\nShe soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide,\r\nwhistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom\r\ndoors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: \"Come and\r\n'ave a look at this, it's dead, just lying there, stone dead!\"\r\n\r\nMr. and  Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had\r\nto make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before\r\nthey could grasp what she was saying.  But then, each from his own\r\nside, they hurried out of bed.  Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his\r\nshoulders,  Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is\r\nhow they went into Gregor's room.  On the way they opened the door\r\nto the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three\r\ngentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never\r\nbeen asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this.\r\n\"Dead?\", asked  Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly,\r\neven though she could have checked for herself and could have known\r\nit even without checking.  \"That's what I said\",  replied the\r\ncleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor's body another shove with\r\nthe broom, sending it sideways across the floor.  Mrs. Samsa made a\r\nmovement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not\r\ncomplete it.  \"Now then\", said  Mr. Samsa, \"let's give thanks to God\r\nfor that\". He crossed himself, and the three women followed his\r\nexample.  Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said:\r\n\"Just look how thin he was.  He didn't eat anything for so long.\r\nThe food came out again just the same as when it went in\". Gregor's\r\nbody was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it\r\nuntil then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did\r\nhe do anything to make them look away.\r\n\r\n\"Grete, come with us in here for a little while\", said  Mrs. Samsa\r\nwith a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom\r\nbut not without looking back at the body.  The cleaner shut the door\r\nand opened the window wide.  Although it was still early in the\r\nmorning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it.  It\r\nwas already the end of March, after all.\r\n\r\nThe three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in\r\namazement for their breakfasts;  they had been forgotten about.\r\n\"Where is our breakfast?\", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner\r\nirritably.  She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and\r\nsilent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor's\r\nroom.  They did so, and stood around Gregor's corpse with their\r\nhands in the pockets of their well-worn coats. It was now quite\r\nlight in the room.\r\n\r\nThen the door of the bedroom opened and  Mr. Samsa appeared in his\r\nuniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other.  All\r\nof them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her\r\nface against her father's arm.\r\n\r\n\"Leave my home.  Now!\", said  Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and\r\nwithout letting the women from him.  \"What do you mean?\", asked the\r\nmiddle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled\r\nsweetly.  The other two held their hands behind their backs and\r\ncontinually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud\r\nquarrel which could only end in their favour.  \"I mean just what I\r\nsaid\", answered  Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a\r\nstraight line towards the man.  At first, he stood there still,\r\nlooking at the ground as if the contents of his head were\r\nrearranging themselves into new positions.  \"Alright, we'll go\r\nthen\", he said, and looked up at  Mr. Samsa as if he had been\r\nsuddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from\r\nMr. Samsa for his decision.  Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide\r\nand briefly nodded to him several times.  At that, and without\r\ndelay, the man actually did take long strides into the front\r\nhallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time\r\nbefore and had been listening to what was being said.  Now they\r\njumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that\r\nMr. Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the\r\nconnection with their leader.  Once there, all three took their hats\r\nfrom the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a\r\nword and left the premises.  Mr. Samsa and the two women followed\r\nthem out onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust\r\nthe men's intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how\r\nthe three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many\r\nsteps.  As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and\r\nwould reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the\r\nmore that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher's\r\nboy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his\r\nway up and came nearer than they were,  Mr. Samsa and the women came\r\naway from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat.\r\n\r\nThey decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation\r\nand to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but\r\nthey were in serious need of it.  So they sat at the table and wrote\r\nthree letters of excusal,  Mr. Samsa to his employers,  Mrs. Samsa\r\nto her contractor and Grete to her principal.  The cleaner came in\r\nwhile they were writing to tell them she was going, she'd finished\r\nher work for that morning.  The three of them at first just nodded\r\nwithout looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when\r\nthe cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up\r\nin irritation.  \"Well?\", asked  Mr. Samsa.  The charwoman stood in\r\nthe doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous\r\ngood news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked\r\nto.  The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which\r\nhad been a source of irritation to  Mr. Samsa all the time she had\r\nbeen working for them, swayed gently in all directions.  \"What is it\r\nyou want then?\", asked  Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most\r\nrespect for.  \"Yes\", she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh\r\nthat made her unable to speak straight away, \"well then, that thing\r\nin there, you needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of it.\r\n That's all been sorted out.\"   Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over\r\ntheir letters as if intent on continuing with what they were\r\nwriting;  Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing\r\neverything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite\r\nclear that she was not to.  So, as she was prevented from telling\r\nthem all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in\r\nand, clearly peeved, called out \"Cheerio then, everyone\", turned\r\nround sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.\r\n\r\n\"Tonight she gets sacked\", said  Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply\r\nfrom either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have\r\ndestroyed the peace they had only just gained.  They got up and went\r\nover to the window where they remained with their arms around each\r\nother.  Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat\r\nthere watching for a while.  Then he called out: \"Come here, then.\r\nLet's forget about all that old stuff, shall we.  Come and give me a\r\nbit of attention\". The two women immediately did as he said,\r\nhurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then\r\nthey quickly finished their letters.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the three of them left the flat together, which was\r\nsomething they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the\r\nopen country outside the town.  They had the tram, filled with warm\r\nsunshine, all to themselves.  Leant back comfortably on their seats,\r\nthey discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination\r\nthey were not at all bad - until then they had never asked each\r\nother about their work but all three had jobs which were very good\r\nand held particularly good promise for the future.  The greatest\r\nimprovement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite\r\neasily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that was\r\nsmaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by\r\nGregor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, more\r\npractical.  All the time, Grete was becoming livelier.  With all the\r\nworry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but,\r\nwhile they were talking,  Mr. and  Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost\r\nsimultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was\r\nblossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.  They became\r\nquieter.  Just from each other's glance and almost without knowing\r\nit they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for\r\nher.  And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good\r\nintentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the\r\nfirst to get up and stretch out her young body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Metamorphosis, by Franz Kafka\r\nTranslated by David Wyllie.\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK METAMORPHOSIS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 5200.txt or 5200.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/5/2/0/5200/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE\r\n\r\nby Robert Louis Stevenson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORY OF THE DOOR\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never\r\nlighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward\r\nin sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable.\r\nAt friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something\r\neminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never\r\nfound its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent\r\nsymbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts\r\nof his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone,\r\nto mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had\r\nnot crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had an approved\r\ntolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high\r\npressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity\r\ninclined to help rather than to reprove. \"I incline to Cain's heresy,\"\r\nhe used to say quaintly: \"I let my brother go to the devil in his own\r\nway.\" In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last\r\nreputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of\r\ndowngoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came about his\r\nchambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative\r\nat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar\r\ncatholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept his\r\nfriendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was\r\nthe lawyer's way. His friends were those of his own blood or those whom\r\nhe had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of\r\ntime, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt the\r\nbond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the\r\nwell-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these\r\ntwo could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common.\r\nIt was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks,\r\nthat they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with\r\nobvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put\r\nthe greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel\r\nof each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but\r\neven resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them\r\nuninterrupted.\r\n\r\nIt chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a\r\nby-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what\r\nis called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The\r\ninhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to\r\ndo better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry;\r\nso that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of\r\ninvitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it\r\nveiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage,\r\nthe street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a\r\nfire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished\r\nbrasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught\r\nand pleased the eye of the passenger.\r\n\r\nTwo doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was\r\nbroken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain\r\nsinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It\r\nwas two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower\r\nstorey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore\r\nin every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The\r\ndoor, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered\r\nand distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the\r\npanels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried\r\nhis knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had\r\nappeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages.\r\n\r\nMr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but\r\nwhen they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and\r\npointed.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever remark that door?\" he asked; and when his companion had\r\nreplied in the affirmative. \"It is connected in my mind,\" added he,\r\n\"with a very odd story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, \"and what\r\nwas that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it was this way,\" returned Mr. Enfield: \"I was coming home from\r\nsome place at the end of the world, about three o'clock of a black\r\nwinter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was\r\nliterally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the\r\nfolks asleep--street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession\r\nand all as empty as a church--till at last I got into that state of mind\r\nwhen a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a\r\npoliceman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was\r\nstumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe\r\neight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross\r\nstreet. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at\r\nthe corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man\r\ntrampled calmly over the child's body and left her screaming on the\r\nground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn't\r\nlike a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,\r\ntook to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where\r\nthere was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was\r\nperfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly\r\nthat it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had\r\nturned out were the girl's own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for\r\nwhom she had been sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not\r\nmuch the worse, more frightened, according to the Sawbones; and there\r\nyou might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one curious\r\ncircumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight. So\r\nhad the child's family, which was only natural. But the doctor's case\r\nwas what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry apothecary, of no\r\nparticular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent and about as\r\nemotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of us; every\r\ntime he looked at my prisoner, I saw that Sawbones turn sick and white\r\nwith desire to kill him. I knew what was in his mind, just as he knew\r\nwhat was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next\r\nbest. We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this\r\nas should make his name stink from one end of London to the other. If\r\nhe had any friends or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them.\r\nAnd all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the\r\nwomen off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies. I never\r\nsaw a circle of such hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle,\r\nwith a kind of black sneering coolness--frightened too, I could see\r\nthat--but carrying it off, sir, really like Satan. `If you choose to\r\nmake capital out of this accident,' said he, `I am naturally helpless.\r\nNo gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene,' says he. `Name your figure.'\r\nWell, we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the child's family; he\r\nwould have clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the\r\nlot of us that meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was\r\nto get the money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place\r\nwith the door?--whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back\r\nwith the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on\r\nCoutts's, drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can't\r\nmention, though it's one of the points of my story, but it was a name at\r\nleast very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the\r\nsignature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took the\r\nliberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked\r\napocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a cellar\r\ndoor at four in the morning and come out with another man's cheque for\r\nclose upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and sneering. `Set\r\nyour mind at rest,' says he, `I will stay with you till the banks open\r\nand cash the cheque myself.' So we all set off, the doctor, and the\r\nchild's father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the\r\nnight in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in\r\na body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself, and said I had every\r\nreason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was\r\ngenuine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut-tut,\" said Mr. Utterson.\r\n\r\n\"I see you feel as I do,\" said Mr. Enfield. \"Yes, it's a bad story. For\r\nmy man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really damnable\r\nman; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the\r\nproprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your\r\nfellows who do what they call good. Black mail I suppose; an honest man\r\npaying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail\r\nHouse is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though\r\neven that, you know, is far from explaining all,\" he added, and with the\r\nwords fell into a vein of musing.\r\n\r\nFrom this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: \"And\r\nyou don't know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?\"\r\n\r\n\"A likely place, isn't it?\" returned Mr. Enfield. \"But I happen to have\r\nnoticed his address; he lives in some square or other.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you never asked about the--place with the door?\" said Mr. Utterson.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir: I had a delicacy,\" was the reply. \"I feel very strongly about\r\nputting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of\r\njudgment. You start a question, and it's like starting a stone. You sit\r\nquietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others;\r\nand presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of)\r\nis knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to\r\nchange their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks\r\nlike Queer Street, the less I ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very good rule, too,\" said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"But I have studied the place for myself,\" continued Mr. Enfield. \"It\r\nseems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in\r\nor out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my\r\nadventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first\r\nfloor; none below; the windows are always shut but they're clean. And\r\nthen there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must\r\nlive there. And yet it's not so sure; for the buildings are so packed\r\ntogether about the court, that it's hard to say where one ends and\r\nanother begins.\"\r\n\r\nThe pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then \"Enfield,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Utterson, \"that's a good rule of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think it is,\" returned Enfield.\r\n\r\n\"But for all that,\" continued the lawyer, \"there's one point I want to\r\nask: I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Enfield, \"I can't see what harm it would do. It was a\r\nman of the name of Hyde.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hm,\" said Mr. Utterson. \"What sort of a man is he to see?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his\r\nappearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I\r\nnever saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be\r\ndeformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I\r\ncouldn't specify the point. He's an extraordinary looking man, and yet\r\nI really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand of\r\nit; I can't describe him. And it's not want of memory; for I declare I\r\ncan see him this moment.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a\r\nweight of consideration. \"You are sure he used a key?\" he inquired at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir...\" began Enfield, surprised out of himself.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Utterson; \"I know it must seem strange. The fact is,\r\nif I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I know\r\nit already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have been\r\ninexact in any point you had better correct it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you might have warned me,\" returned the other with a touch of\r\nsullenness. \"But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The\r\nfellow had a key; and what's more, he has it still. I saw him use it not\r\na week ago.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man\r\npresently resumed. \"Here is another lesson to say nothing,\" said he. \"I\r\nam ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to\r\nthis again.\"\r\n\r\n\"With all my heart,\" said the lawyer. \"I shake hands on that, Richard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEARCH FOR MR. HYDE\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre\r\nspirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a\r\nSunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume\r\nof some dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the\r\nneighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go\r\nsoberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the\r\ncloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business\r\nroom. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a\r\ndocument endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll's Will and sat down with\r\na clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for Mr.\r\nUtterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had refused\r\nto lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided not only\r\nthat, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D.,\r\nF.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his\r\n\"friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,\" but that in case of Dr. Jekyll's\r\n\"disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three\r\ncalendar months,\" the said Edward Hyde should step into the said Henry\r\nJekyll's shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or\r\nobligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the\r\ndoctor's household. This document had long been the lawyer's eyesore. It\r\noffended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary\r\nsides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And hitherto it\r\nwas his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his indignation; now, by\r\na sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was already bad enough when the\r\nname was but a name of which he could learn no more. It was worse when\r\nit began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes; and out of the\r\nshifting, insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye, there\r\nleaped up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was madness,\" he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper\r\nin the safe, \"and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.\"\r\n\r\nWith that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in\r\nthe direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his\r\nfriend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding\r\npatients. \"If anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,\" he had thought.\r\n\r\nThe solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage\r\nof delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where\r\nDr. Lanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper,\r\nred-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a\r\nboisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up\r\nfrom his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was\r\nthe way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed\r\non genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at\r\nschool and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each\r\nother, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each\r\nother's company.\r\n\r\nAfter a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so\r\ndisagreeably preoccupied his mind.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose, Lanyon,\" said he, \"you and I must be the two oldest friends\r\nthat Henry Jekyll has?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish the friends were younger,\" chuckled Dr. Lanyon. \"But I suppose\r\nwe are. And what of that? I see little of him now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" said Utterson. \"I thought you had a bond of common interest.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had,\" was the reply. \"But it is more than ten years since Henry\r\nJekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind;\r\nand though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old\r\nsake's sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the\r\nman. Such unscientific balderdash,\" added the doctor, flushing suddenly\r\npurple, \"would have estranged Damon and Pythias.\"\r\n\r\nThis little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.\r\n\"They have only differed on some point of science,\" he thought;\r\nand being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of\r\nconveyancing), he even added: \"It is nothing worse than that!\" He gave\r\nhis friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached\r\nthe question he had come to put. \"Did you ever come across a protege of\r\nhis--one Hyde?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Hyde?\" repeated Lanyon. \"No. Never heard of him. Since my time.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with him\r\nto the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the small\r\nhours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of little ease\r\nto his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and beseiged by questions.\r\n\r\nSix o'clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently\r\nnear to Mr. Utterson's dwelling, and still he was digging at the\r\nproblem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone; but\r\nnow his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he lay\r\nand tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room,\r\nMr. Enfield's tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted\r\npictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal\r\ncity; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child\r\nrunning from the doctor's; and then these met, and that human Juggernaut\r\ntrod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams. Or else he\r\nwould see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming\r\nand smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be\r\nopened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and\r\nlo! there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given, and\r\neven at that dead hour, he must rise and do its bidding. The figure in\r\nthese two phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time he\r\ndozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping\r\nhouses, or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly, even to\r\ndizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city, and at every\r\nstreet corner crush a child and leave her screaming. And still the\r\nfigure had no face by which he might know it; even in his dreams, it had\r\nno face, or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes; and thus\r\nit was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer's mind a\r\nsingularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the\r\nfeatures of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but once set eyes on him, he\r\nthought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as\r\nwas the habit of mysterious things when well examined. He might see a\r\nreason for his friend's strange preference or bondage (call it which you\r\nplease) and even for the startling clause of the will. At least it would\r\nbe a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of\r\nmercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of\r\nthe unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the\r\nby-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when\r\nbusiness was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the face of\r\nthe fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or\r\nconcourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.\r\n\r\n\"If he be Mr. Hyde,\" he had thought, \"I shall be Mr. Seek.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost in\r\nthe air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken\r\nby any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten\r\no'clock, when the shops were closed the by-street was very solitary and,\r\nin spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small\r\nsounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly\r\naudible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach\r\nof any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been some\r\nminutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light footstep drawing\r\nnear. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed\r\nto the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while\r\nhe is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast\r\nhum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention had never before been so\r\nsharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong, superstitious\r\nprevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court.\r\n\r\nThe steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they\r\nturned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry,\r\ncould soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and\r\nvery plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went\r\nsomehow strongly against the watcher's inclination. But he made straight\r\nfor the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he came, he drew\r\na key from his pocket like one approaching home.\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.\r\n\"Mr. Hyde, I think?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear\r\nwas only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face,\r\nhe answered coolly enough: \"That is my name. What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see you are going in,\" returned the lawyer. \"I am an old friend of\r\nDr. Jekyll's--Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street--you must have heard of my\r\nname; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,\" replied Mr. Hyde,\r\nblowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,\r\n\"How did you know me?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"On your side,\" said Mr. Utterson \"will you do me a favour?\"\r\n\r\n\"With pleasure,\" replied the other. \"What shall it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you let me see your face?\" asked the lawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden\r\nreflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared\r\nat each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. \"Now I shall know you\r\nagain,\" said Mr. Utterson. \"It may be useful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" returned Mr. Hyde, \"It is as well we have met; and apropos, you\r\nshould have my address.\" And he gave a number of a street in Soho.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" thought Mr. Utterson, \"can he, too, have been thinking\r\nof the will?\" But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in\r\nacknowledgment of the address.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said the other, \"how did you know me?\"\r\n\r\n\"By description,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Whose description?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have common friends,\" said Mr. Utterson.\r\n\r\n\"Common friends,\" echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. \"Who are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jekyll, for instance,\" said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"He never told you,\" cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. \"I did not\r\nthink you would have lied.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said Mr. Utterson, \"that is not fitting language.\"\r\n\r\nThe other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with\r\nextraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of\r\ndisquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every\r\nstep or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental\r\nperplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a\r\nclass that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave\r\nan impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had\r\na displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of\r\nmurderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,\r\nwhispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against\r\nhim, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown\r\ndisgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him.\r\n\"There must be something else,\" said the perplexed gentleman. \"There\r\nis something more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man\r\nseems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be\r\nthe old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul\r\nthat thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The\r\nlast, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan's\r\nsignature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.\"\r\n\r\nRound the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,\r\nhandsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate\r\nand let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men;\r\nmap-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure\r\nenterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still\r\noccupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of\r\nwealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for\r\nthe fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly\r\nservant opened the door.\r\n\r\n\"Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?\" asked the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"I will see, Mr. Utterson,\" said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he\r\nspoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags,\r\nwarmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,\r\nand furnished with costly cabinets of oak. \"Will you wait here by the\r\nfire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, thank you,\" said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the\r\ntall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy\r\nof his friend the doctor's; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of\r\nit as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder in\r\nhis blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what was\r\nrare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of his\r\nspirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight\r\non the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the\r\nroof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently returned to\r\nannounce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.\r\n\r\n\"I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,\" he said. \"Is\r\nthat right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,\" replied the servant. \"Mr. Hyde has a\r\nkey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man,\r\nPoole,\" resumed the other musingly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, he does indeed,\" said Poole. \"We have all orders to obey\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?\" asked Utterson.\r\n\r\n\"O, dear no, sir. He never dines here,\" replied the butler. \"Indeed we\r\nsee very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes and\r\ngoes by the laboratory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-night, Poole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, Mr. Utterson.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. \"Poor Harry\r\nJekyll,\" he thought, \"my mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was\r\nwild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of\r\nGod, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost\r\nof some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment\r\ncoming, PEDE CLAUDO, years after memory has forgotten and self-love\r\ncondoned the fault.\" And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded\r\nawhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least\r\nby chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light\r\nthere. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of\r\ntheir life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by\r\nthe many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and\r\nfearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.\r\nAnd then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of\r\nhope. \"This Master Hyde, if he were studied,\" thought he, \"must have\r\nsecrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared\r\nto which poor Jekyll's worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot\r\ncontinue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature\r\nstealing like a thief to Harry's bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening!\r\nAnd the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the\r\nwill, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to\r\nthe wheel--if Jekyll will but let me,\" he added, \"if Jekyll will\r\nonly let me.\" For once more he saw before his mind's eye, as clear as\r\ntransparency, the strange clauses of the will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE\r\n\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of\r\nhis pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent,\r\nreputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so contrived\r\nthat he remained behind after the others had departed. This was no new\r\narrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of times. Where\r\nUtterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to detain the dry\r\nlawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had already their foot\r\non the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company,\r\npractising for solitude, sobering their minds in the man's rich silence\r\nafter the expense and strain of gaiety. To this rule, Dr. Jekyll was no\r\nexception; and as he now sat on the opposite side of the fire--a large,\r\nwell-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with something of a stylish cast\r\nperhaps, but every mark of capacity and kindness--you could see by his\r\nlooks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson a sincere and warm affection.\r\n\r\n\"I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,\" began the latter. \"You\r\nknow that will of yours?\"\r\n\r\nA close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful; but\r\nthe doctor carried it off gaily. \"My poor Utterson,\" said he, \"you are\r\nunfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as you\r\nwere by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at what\r\nhe called my scientific heresies. O, I know he's a good fellow--you\r\nneedn't frown--an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of\r\nhim; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant.\r\nI was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know I never approved of it,\" pursued Utterson, ruthlessly\r\ndisregarding the fresh topic.\r\n\r\n\"My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,\" said the doctor, a trifle\r\nsharply. \"You have told me so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I tell you so again,\" continued the lawyer. \"I have been learning\r\nsomething of young Hyde.\"\r\n\r\nThe large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and\r\nthere came a blackness about his eyes. \"I do not care to hear more,\"\r\nsaid he. \"This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I heard was abominable,\" said Utterson.\r\n\r\n\"It can make no change. You do not understand my position,\" returned the\r\ndoctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. \"I am painfully situated,\r\nUtterson; my position is a very strange--a very strange one. It is one\r\nof those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jekyll,\" said Utterson, \"you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make\r\na clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you\r\nout of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good Utterson,\" said the doctor, \"this is very good of you, this\r\nis downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I\r\nbelieve you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before\r\nmyself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn't what you fancy;\r\nit is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I\r\nwill tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.\r\nI give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I\r\nwill just add one little word, Utterson, that I'm sure you'll take in\r\ngood part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.\"\r\n\r\nUtterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt you are perfectly right,\" he said at last, getting to\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n\"Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last\r\ntime I hope,\" continued the doctor, \"there is one point I should like\r\nyou to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. I\r\nknow you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I do\r\nsincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if\r\nI am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear\r\nwith him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew all;\r\nand it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't pretend that I shall ever like him,\" said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"I don't ask that,\" pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other's\r\narm; \"I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake,\r\nwhen I am no longer here.\"\r\n\r\nUtterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. \"Well,\" said he, \"I promise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAREW MURDER CASE\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly a year later, in the month of October, 18--, London was startled\r\nby a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the\r\nhigh position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A\r\nmaid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone\r\nupstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in the\r\nsmall hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane,\r\nwhich the maid's window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full\r\nmoon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon her\r\nbox, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream of\r\nmusing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she narrated\r\nthat experience), never had she felt more at peace with all men or\r\nthought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she became aware\r\nof an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near along the\r\nlane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small gentleman, to\r\nwhom at first she paid less attention. When they had come within speech\r\n(which was just under the maid's eyes) the older man bowed and accosted\r\nthe other with a very pretty manner of politeness. It did not seem as\r\nif the subject of his address were of great importance; indeed, from his\r\npointing, it some times appeared as if he were only inquiring his way;\r\nbut the moon shone on his face as he spoke, and the girl was pleased to\r\nwatch it, it seemed to breathe such an innocent and old-world kindness\r\nof disposition, yet with something high too, as of a well-founded\r\nself-content. Presently her eye wandered to the other, and she was\r\nsurprised to recognise in him a certain Mr. Hyde, who had once visited\r\nher master and for whom she had conceived a dislike. He had in his hand\r\na heavy cane, with which he was trifling; but he answered never a word,\r\nand seemed to listen with an ill-contained impatience. And then all of\r\na sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with his foot,\r\nbrandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like\r\na madman. The old gentleman took a step back, with the air of one very\r\nmuch surprised and a trifle hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of\r\nall bounds and clubbed him to the earth. And next moment, with ape-like\r\nfury, he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of\r\nblows, under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped\r\nupon the roadway. At the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid\r\nfainted.\r\n\r\nIt was two o'clock when she came to herself and called for the police.\r\nThe murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle\r\nof the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been\r\ndone, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had\r\nbroken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and\r\none splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter--the other,\r\nwithout doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold\r\nwatch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a\r\nsealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the\r\npost, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.\r\n\r\nThis was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of\r\nbed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than\r\nhe shot out a solemn lip. \"I shall say nothing till I have seen the\r\nbody,\" said he; \"this may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait\r\nwhile I dress.\" And with the same grave countenance he hurried through\r\nhis breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had been\r\ncarried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir\r\nDanvers Carew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God, sir,\" exclaimed the officer, \"is it possible?\" And the next\r\nmoment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. \"This will make a\r\ndeal of noise,\" he said. \"And perhaps you can help us to the man.\" And\r\nhe briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken stick.\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the stick\r\nwas laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and battered as it\r\nwas, he recognized it for one that he had himself presented many years\r\nbefore to Henry Jekyll.\r\n\r\n\"Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid\r\ncalls him,\" said the officer.\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, \"If you will come\r\nwith me in my cab,\" he said, \"I think I can take you to his house.\"\r\n\r\nIt was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the\r\nseason. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the\r\nwind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so\r\nthat as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a\r\nmarvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be\r\ndark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich,\r\nlurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here,\r\nfor a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft\r\nof daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal\r\nquarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy\r\nways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never\r\nbeen extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful\r\nreinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer's eyes, like a district of\r\nsome city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of the\r\ngloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive, he\r\nwas conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law's\r\nofficers, which may at times assail the most honest.\r\n\r\nAs the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a little\r\nand showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating house,\r\na shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many ragged\r\nchildren huddled in the doorways, and many women of many different\r\nnationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning glass; and\r\nthe next moment the fog settled down again upon that part, as brown as\r\number, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings. This was the\r\nhome of Henry Jekyll's favourite; of a man who was heir to a quarter of\r\na million sterling.\r\n\r\nAn ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an\r\nevil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes,\r\nshe said, this was Mr. Hyde's, but he was not at home; he had been in\r\nthat night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour;\r\nthere was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and\r\nhe was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she\r\nhad seen him till yesterday.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,\" said the lawyer; and when\r\nthe woman began to declare it was impossible, \"I had better tell you\r\nwho this person is,\" he added. \"This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland\r\nYard.\"\r\n\r\nA flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman's face. \"Ah!\" said she,\r\n\"he is in trouble! What has he done?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. \"He don't seem a very\r\npopular character,\" observed the latter. \"And now, my good woman, just\r\nlet me and this gentleman have a look about us.\"\r\n\r\nIn the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained\r\notherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these\r\nwere furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with\r\nwine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung\r\nupon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who was\r\nmuch of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable\r\nin colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark of having\r\nbeen recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the floor,\r\nwith their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and on the\r\nhearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had been\r\nburned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a\r\ngreen cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the other\r\nhalf of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched his\r\nsuspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the bank,\r\nwhere several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderer's\r\ncredit, completed his gratification.\r\n\r\n\"You may depend upon it, sir,\" he told Mr. Utterson: \"I have him in my\r\nhand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick\r\nor, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money's life to the man.\r\nWe have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the\r\nhandbills.\"\r\n\r\nThis last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had\r\nnumbered few familiars--even the master of the servant maid had only\r\nseen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been\r\nphotographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as\r\ncommon observers will. Only on one point were they agreed; and that\r\nwas the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive\r\nimpressed his beholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENT OF THE LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr.\r\nJekyll's door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down\r\nby the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden,\r\nto the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or\r\ndissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of\r\na celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than\r\nanatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of\r\nthe garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in\r\nthat part of his friend's quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless\r\nstructure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of\r\nstrangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager\r\nstudents and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical\r\napparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw,\r\nand the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the further\r\nend, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize;\r\nand through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the doctor's\r\ncabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses, furnished,\r\namong other things, with a cheval-glass and a business table, and\r\nlooking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron. The\r\nfire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf,\r\nfor even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and there, close up\r\nto the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He did not rise\r\nto meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a\r\nchanged voice.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, \"you have\r\nheard the news?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor shuddered. \"They were crying it in the square,\" he said. \"I\r\nheard them in my dining-room.\"\r\n\r\n\"One word,\" said the lawyer. \"Carew was my client, but so are you, and I\r\nwant to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide this\r\nfellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Utterson, I swear to God,\" cried the doctor, \"I swear to God I will\r\nnever set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done with\r\nhim in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not want my\r\nhelp; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite safe; mark my\r\nwords, he will never more be heard of.\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend's feverish\r\nmanner. \"You seem pretty sure of him,\" said he; \"and for your sake, I\r\nhope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am quite sure of him,\" replied Jekyll; \"I have grounds for certainty\r\nthat I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you\r\nmay advise me. I have--I have received a letter; and I am at a loss\r\nwhether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in\r\nyour hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so great\r\na trust in you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?\" asked the\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the other. \"I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I\r\nam quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this\r\nhateful business has rather exposed.\"\r\n\r\nUtterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend's selfishness,\r\nand yet relieved by it. \"Well,\" said he, at last, \"let me see the\r\nletter.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed \"Edward Hyde\":\r\nand it signified, briefly enough, that the writer's benefactor,\r\nDr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand\r\ngenerosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had means\r\nof escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked this\r\nletter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had\r\nlooked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.\r\n\r\n\"Have you the envelope?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I burned it,\" replied Jekyll, \"before I thought what I was about. But\r\nit bore no postmark. The note was handed in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?\" asked Utterson.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you to judge for me entirely,\" was the reply. \"I have lost\r\nconfidence in myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I shall consider,\" returned the lawyer. \"And now one word\r\nmore: it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that\r\ndisappearance?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth\r\ntight and nodded.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it,\" said Utterson. \"He meant to murder you. You had a fine\r\nescape.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had what is far more to the purpose,\" returned the doctor\r\nsolemnly: \"I have had a lesson--O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have\r\nhad!\" And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.\r\n\r\nOn his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole. \"By\r\nthe bye,\" said he, \"there was a letter handed in to-day: what was the\r\nmessenger like?\" But Poole was positive nothing had come except by post;\r\n\"and only circulars by that,\" he added.\r\n\r\nThis news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the\r\nletter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been\r\nwritten in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently\r\njudged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went,\r\nwere crying themselves hoarse along the footways: \"Special edition.\r\nShocking murder of an M.P.\" That was the funeral oration of one friend\r\nand client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good\r\nname of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It\r\nwas, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and self-reliant\r\nas he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for advice. It was not\r\nto be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it might be fished for.\r\n\r\nPresently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr.\r\nGuest, his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely\r\ncalculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine\r\nthat had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The\r\nfog still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps\r\nglimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these\r\nfallen clouds, the procession of the town's life was still rolling in\r\nthrough the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the\r\nroom was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago\r\nresolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows\r\nricher in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on\r\nhillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs of\r\nLondon. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he kept\r\nfewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he kept as\r\nmany as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the doctor's;\r\nhe knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr. Hyde's\r\nfamiliarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it not as\r\nwell, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery to\r\nright? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic of\r\nhandwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The clerk,\r\nbesides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a\r\ndocument without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson\r\nmight shape his future course.\r\n\r\n\"This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,\"\r\nreturned Guest. \"The man, of course, was mad.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to hear your views on that,\" replied Utterson. \"I have a\r\ndocument here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce\r\nknow what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there\r\nit is; quite in your way: a murderer's autograph.\"\r\n\r\nGuest's eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with\r\npassion. \"No sir,\" he said: \"not mad; but it is an odd hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"And by all accounts a very odd writer,\" added the lawyer.\r\n\r\nJust then the servant entered with a note.\r\n\r\n\"Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?\" inquired the clerk. \"I thought I knew\r\nthe writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment. I thank you, sir;\" and the clerk laid the two sheets of\r\npaper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. \"Thank you,\r\nsir,\" he said at last, returning both; \"it's a very interesting\r\nautograph.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself.\r\n\"Why did you compare them, Guest?\" he inquired suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" returned the clerk, \"there's a rather singular resemblance;\r\nthe two hands are in many points identical: only differently sloped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather quaint,\" said Utterson.\r\n\r\n\"It is, as you say, rather quaint,\" returned Guest.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't speak of this note, you know,\" said the master.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said the clerk. \"I understand.\"\r\n\r\nBut no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the\r\nnote into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. \"What!\" he\r\nthought. \"Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer!\" And his blood ran cold in\r\nhis veins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENT OF DR. LANYON\r\n\r\n\r\nTime ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the\r\ndeath of Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had\r\ndisappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never existed.\r\nMuch of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable: tales came\r\nout of the man's cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of his vile\r\nlife, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to have\r\nsurrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a whisper.\r\nFrom the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of the\r\nmurder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on, Mr.\r\nUtterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to grow\r\nmore at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his way of\r\nthinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde. Now that\r\nthat evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for Dr. Jekyll.\r\nHe came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his friends, became\r\nonce more their familiar guest and entertainer; and whilst he had always\r\nbeen known for charities, he was now no less distinguished for religion.\r\nHe was busy, he was much in the open air, he did good; his face seemed\r\nto open and brighten, as if with an inward consciousness of service; and\r\nfor more than two months, the doctor was at peace.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor's with a small\r\nparty; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from\r\none to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable\r\nfriends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against\r\nthe lawyer. \"The doctor was confined to the house,\" Poole said, \"and saw\r\nno one.\" On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and having\r\nnow been used for the last two months to see his friend almost daily, he\r\nfound this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The fifth night\r\nhe had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook himself to Dr.\r\nLanyon's.\r\n\r\nThere at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he was\r\nshocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor's appearance.\r\nHe had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The rosy man had\r\ngrown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly balder and older;\r\nand yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift physical decay that\r\narrested the lawyer's notice, as a look in the eye and quality of manner\r\nthat seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror of the mind. It\r\nwas unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet that was what\r\nUtterson was tempted to suspect. \"Yes,\" he thought; \"he is a doctor, he\r\nmust know his own state and that his days are counted; and the knowledge\r\nis more than he can bear.\" And yet when Utterson remarked on his\r\nill-looks, it was with an air of great firmness that Lanyon declared\r\nhimself a doomed man.\r\n\r\n\"I have had a shock,\" he said, \"and I shall never recover. It is a\r\nquestion of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir,\r\nI used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more\r\nglad to get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jekyll is ill, too,\" observed Utterson. \"Have you seen him?\"\r\n\r\nBut Lanyon's face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. \"I wish to\r\nsee or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,\" he said in a loud, unsteady voice.\r\n\"I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any\r\nallusion to one whom I regard as dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut-tut,\" said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,\r\n\"Can't I do anything?\" he inquired. \"We are three very old friends,\r\nLanyon; we shall not live to make others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing can be done,\" returned Lanyon; \"ask himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will not see me,\" said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"I am not surprised at that,\" was the reply. \"Some day, Utterson, after\r\nI am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I\r\ncannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me\r\nof other things, for God's sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep\r\nclear of this accursed topic, then in God's name, go, for I cannot bear\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,\r\ncomplaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of\r\nthis unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long\r\nanswer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious\r\nin drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. \"I do not blame our old\r\nfriend,\" Jekyll wrote, \"but I share his view that we must never meet. I\r\nmean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you must not\r\nbe surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is often shut\r\neven to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I have brought on\r\nmyself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If I am the chief\r\nof sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could not think that\r\nthis earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so unmanning;\r\nand you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this destiny, and\r\nthat is to respect my silence.\" Utterson was amazed; the dark influence\r\nof Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to his old tasks\r\nand amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with every promise of a\r\ncheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment, friendship, and peace\r\nof mind, and the whole tenor of his life were wrecked. So great and\r\nunprepared a change pointed to madness; but in view of Lanyon's manner\r\nand words, there must lie for it some deeper ground.\r\n\r\nA week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less than\r\na fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he had\r\nbeen sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room,\r\nand sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set\r\nbefore him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal of\r\nhis dead friend. \"PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE, and in\r\ncase of his predecease to be destroyed unread,\" so it was emphatically\r\nsuperscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents. \"I have\r\nburied one friend to-day,\" he thought: \"what if this should cost me\r\nanother?\" And then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and broke the\r\nseal. Within there was another enclosure, likewise sealed, and marked\r\nupon the cover as \"not to be opened till the death or disappearance\r\nof Dr. Henry Jekyll.\" Utterson could not trust his eyes. Yes, it was\r\ndisappearance; here again, as in the mad will which he had long ago\r\nrestored to its author, here again were the idea of a disappearance\r\nand the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in the will, that idea had\r\nsprung from the sinister suggestion of the man Hyde; it was set there\r\nwith a purpose all too plain and horrible. Written by the hand of\r\nLanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity came on the trustee,\r\nto disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these\r\nmysteries; but professional honour and faith to his dead friend were\r\nstringent obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his\r\nprivate safe.\r\n\r\nIt is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may\r\nbe doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his\r\nsurviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but\r\nhis thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but he\r\nwas perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart, he\r\npreferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the\r\nair and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into that\r\nhouse of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its inscrutable\r\nrecluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to communicate. The\r\ndoctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined himself to the cabinet\r\nover the laboratory, where he would sometimes even sleep; he was out of\r\nspirits, he had grown very silent, he did not read; it seemed as if\r\nhe had something on his mind. Utterson became so used to the unvarying\r\ncharacter of these reports, that he fell off little by little in the\r\nfrequency of his visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENT AT THE WINDOW\r\n\r\n\r\nIt chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.\r\nEnfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that\r\nwhen they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Enfield, \"that story's at an end at least. We shall never\r\nsee more of Mr. Hyde.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not,\" said Utterson. \"Did I ever tell you that I once saw him,\r\nand shared your feeling of repulsion?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was impossible to do the one without the other,\" returned Enfield.\r\n\"And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that\r\nthis was a back way to Dr. Jekyll's! It was partly your own fault that I\r\nfound it out, even when I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you found it out, did you?\" said Utterson. \"But if that be so, we\r\nmay step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the\r\ntruth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if the\r\npresence of a friend might do him good.\"\r\n\r\nThe court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature\r\ntwilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with\r\nsunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and\r\nsitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of\r\nmien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.\r\n\r\n\"What! Jekyll!\" he cried. \"I trust you are better.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very low, Utterson,\" replied the doctor drearily, \"very low. It\r\nwill not last long, thank God.\"\r\n\r\n\"You stay too much indoors,\" said the lawyer. \"You should be out,\r\nwhipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my\r\ncousin--Mr. Enfield--Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a\r\nquick turn with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very good,\" sighed the other. \"I should like to very much; but\r\nno, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson,\r\nI am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask\r\nyou and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then,\" said the lawyer, good-naturedly, \"the best thing we can do\r\nis to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is just what I was about to venture to propose,\" returned the\r\ndoctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before the smile\r\nwas struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such abject\r\nterror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen below.\r\nThey saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly thrust down;\r\nbut that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and left the court\r\nwithout a word. In silence, too, they traversed the by-street; and it\r\nwas not until they had come into a neighbouring thoroughfare, where even\r\nupon a Sunday there were still some stirrings of life, that Mr. Utterson\r\nat last turned and looked at his companion. They were both pale; and\r\nthere was an answering horror in their eyes.\r\n\r\n\"God forgive us, God forgive us,\" said Mr. Utterson.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once\r\nmore in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when\r\nhe was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.\r\n\r\n\"Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?\" he cried; and then taking a\r\nsecond look at him, \"What ails you?\" he added; \"is the doctor ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Utterson,\" said the man, \"there is something wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,\" said the lawyer.\r\n\"Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know the doctor's ways, sir,\" replied Poole, \"and how he shuts\r\nhimself up. Well, he's shut up again in the cabinet; and I don't like\r\nit, sir--I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, my good man,\" said the lawyer, \"be explicit. What are you afraid\r\nof?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been afraid for about a week,\" returned Poole, doggedly\r\ndisregarding the question, \"and I can bear it no more.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered\r\nfor the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced his\r\nterror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he sat\r\nwith the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed to a\r\ncorner of the floor. \"I can bear it no more,\" he repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said the lawyer, \"I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see\r\nthere is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think there's been foul play,\" said Poole, hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"Foul play!\" cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather\r\ninclined to be irritated in consequence. \"What foul play! What does the\r\nman mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I daren't say, sir,\" was the answer; \"but will you come along with me\r\nand see for yourself?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson's only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;\r\nbut he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared\r\nupon the butler's face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was\r\nstill untasted when he set it down to follow.\r\n\r\nIt was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying\r\non her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the\r\nmost diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and\r\nflecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets\r\nunusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had\r\nnever seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it\r\notherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to\r\nsee and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there was\r\nborne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The square,\r\nwhen they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in\r\nthe garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole, who had\r\nkept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of\r\nthe pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off his hat and\r\nmopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all the hurry of\r\nhis coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away, but\r\nthe moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face was white and his\r\nvoice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" he said, \"here we are, and God grant there be nothing\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen, Poole,\" said the lawyer.\r\n\r\nThereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was\r\nopened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, \"Is that you,\r\nPoole?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right,\" said Poole. \"Open the door.\"\r\n\r\nThe hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was\r\nbuilt high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and\r\nwomen, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of Mr.\r\nUtterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the cook,\r\ncrying out \"Bless God! it's Mr. Utterson,\" ran forward as if to take him\r\nin her arms.\r\n\r\n\"What, what? Are you all here?\" said the lawyer peevishly. \"Very\r\nirregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're all afraid,\" said Poole.\r\n\r\nBlank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her\r\nvoice and now wept loudly.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue!\" Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that\r\ntestified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so\r\nsuddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and\r\nturned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation.\r\n\"And now,\" continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, \"reach me a\r\ncandle, and we'll get this through hands at once.\" And then he begged\r\nMr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir,\" said he, \"you come as gently as you can. I want you to hear,\r\nand I don't want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any chance he\r\nwas to ask you in, don't go.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson's nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk\r\nthat nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage\r\nand followed the butler into the laboratory building through the\r\nsurgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot\r\nof the stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen;\r\nwhile he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and obvious\r\ncall on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a somewhat\r\nuncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,\" he called; and even as he did\r\nso, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.\r\n\r\nA voice answered from within: \"Tell him I cannot see anyone,\" it said\r\ncomplainingly.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in\r\nhis voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across the\r\nyard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the beetles\r\nwere leaping on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, \"Was that my master's\r\nvoice?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems much changed,\" replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look\r\nfor look.\r\n\r\n\"Changed? Well, yes, I think so,\" said the butler. \"Have I been twenty\r\nyears in this man's house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir;\r\nmaster's made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we\r\nheard him cry out upon the name of God; and who's in there instead\r\nof him, and why it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr.\r\nUtterson!\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my man,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. \"Suppose it were as you suppose,\r\nsupposing Dr. Jekyll to have been--well, murdered what could induce the\r\nmurderer to stay? That won't hold water; it doesn't commend itself to\r\nreason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I'll do it yet,\"\r\nsaid Poole. \"All this last week (you must know) him, or it, whatever it\r\nis that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and day for some\r\nsort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was sometimes his\r\nway--the master's, that is--to write his orders on a sheet of paper and\r\nthrow it on the stair. We've had nothing else this week back; nothing\r\nbut papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left there to be\r\nsmuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day, ay, and twice\r\nand thrice in the same day, there have been orders and complaints, and I\r\nhave been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in town. Every time\r\nI brought the stuff back, there would be another paper telling me to\r\nreturn it, because it was not pure, and another order to a different\r\nfirm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir, whatever for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any of these papers?\" asked Mr. Utterson.\r\n\r\nPoole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the\r\nlawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents\r\nran thus: \"Dr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He\r\nassures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his\r\npresent purpose. In the year 18--, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large\r\nquantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedulous\r\ncare, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at\r\nonce. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can\r\nhardly be exaggerated.\" So far the letter had run composedly enough, but\r\nhere with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer's emotion had broken\r\nloose. \"For God's sake,\" he added, \"find me some of the old.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a strange note,\" said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, \"How do\r\nyou come to have it open?\"\r\n\r\n\"The man at Maw's was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like\r\nso much dirt,\" returned Poole.\r\n\r\n\"This is unquestionably the doctor's hand, do you know?\" resumed the\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it looked like it,\" said the servant rather sulkily; and\r\nthen, with another voice, \"But what matters hand of write?\" he said.\r\n\"I've seen him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Seen him?\" repeated Mr. Utterson. \"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it!\" said Poole. \"It was this way. I came suddenly into the\r\ntheatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this\r\ndrug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was\r\nat the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when\r\nI came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet. It\r\nwas but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my head\r\nlike quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon his\r\nface? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run from\r\nme? I have served him long enough. And then...\" The man paused and\r\npassed his hand over his face.\r\n\r\n\"These are all very strange circumstances,\" said Mr. Utterson, \"but I\r\nthink I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is plainly seized\r\nwith one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer;\r\nhence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask and\r\nthe avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this drug, by\r\nmeans of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate recovery--God\r\ngrant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; it is sad\r\nenough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain and\r\nnatural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant\r\nalarms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, \"that thing\r\nwas not my master, and there's the truth. My master\"--here he looked\r\nround him and began to whisper--\"is a tall, fine build of a man, and\r\nthis was more of a dwarf.\" Utterson attempted to protest. \"O, sir,\"\r\ncried Poole, \"do you think I do not know my master after twenty years?\r\nDo you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door,\r\nwhere I saw him every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in the\r\nmask was never Dr. Jekyll--God knows what it was, but it was never Dr.\r\nJekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poole,\" replied the lawyer, \"if you say that, it will become my duty to\r\nmake certain. Much as I desire to spare your master's feelings, much as\r\nI am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still alive, I\r\nshall consider it my duty to break in that door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Mr. Utterson, that's talking!\" cried the butler.\r\n\r\n\"And now comes the second question,\" resumed Utterson: \"Who is going to\r\ndo it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you and me, sir,\" was the undaunted reply.\r\n\r\n\"That's very well said,\" returned the lawyer; \"and whatever comes of it,\r\nI shall make it my business to see you are no loser.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is an axe in the theatre,\" continued Poole; \"and you might take\r\nthe kitchen poker for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and\r\nbalanced it. \"Do you know, Poole,\" he said, looking up, \"that you and I\r\nare about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may say so, sir, indeed,\" returned the butler.\r\n\r\n\"It is well, then that we should be frank,\" said the other. \"We both\r\nthink more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This masked\r\nfigure that you saw, did you recognise it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that\r\nI could hardly swear to that,\" was the answer. \"But if you mean, was it\r\nMr. Hyde?--why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same\r\nbigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who else\r\ncould have got in by the laboratory door? You have not forgot, sir, that\r\nat the time of the murder he had still the key with him? But that's not\r\nall. I don't know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr. Hyde?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the lawyer, \"I once spoke with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something\r\nqueer about that gentleman--something that gave a man a turn--I don't\r\nknow rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your\r\nmarrow kind of cold and thin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I own I felt something of what you describe,\" said Mr. Utterson.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so, sir,\" returned Poole. \"Well, when that masked thing like a\r\nmonkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it\r\nwent down my spine like ice. O, I know it's not evidence, Mr. Utterson;\r\nI'm book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I give\r\nyou my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" said the lawyer. \"My fears incline to the same point. Evil,\r\nI fear, founded--evil was sure to come--of that connection. Ay truly, I\r\nbelieve you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer\r\n(for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim's\r\nroom. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw.\"\r\n\r\nThe footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.\r\n\r\n\"Put yourself together, Bradshaw,\" said the lawyer. \"This suspense, I\r\nknow, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make\r\nan end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the\r\ncabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear\r\nthe blame. Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any\r\nmalefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round the\r\ncorner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the laboratory\r\ndoor. We give you ten minutes, to get to your stations.\"\r\n\r\nAs Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. \"And now, Poole, let\r\nus get to ours,\" he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the\r\nway into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now\r\nquite dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that\r\ndeep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about\r\ntheir steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where they\r\nsat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but nearer\r\nat hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a footfall\r\nmoving to and fro along the cabinet floor.\r\n\r\n\"So it will walk all day, sir,\" whispered Poole; \"ay, and the better\r\npart of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist,\r\nthere's a bit of a break. Ah, it's an ill conscience that's such an\r\nenemy to rest! Ah, sir, there's blood foully shed in every step of\r\nit! But hark again, a little closer--put your heart in your ears, Mr.\r\nUtterson, and tell me, is that the doctor's foot?\"\r\n\r\nThe steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they\r\nwent so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread of\r\nHenry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. \"Is there never anything else?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nPoole nodded. \"Once,\" he said. \"Once I heard it weeping!\"\r\n\r\n\"Weeping? how that?\" said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\n\"Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,\" said the butler. \"I came away\r\nwith that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.\"\r\n\r\nBut now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe from\r\nunder a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest\r\ntable to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath\r\nto where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in\r\nthe quiet of the night. \"Jekyll,\" cried Utterson, with a loud voice, \"I\r\ndemand to see you.\" He paused a moment, but there came no reply. \"I give\r\nyou fair warning, our suspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see\r\nyou,\" he resumed; \"if not by fair means, then by foul--if not of your\r\nconsent, then by brute force!\"\r\n\r\n\"Utterson,\" said the voice, \"for God's sake, have mercy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's not Jekyll's voice--it's Hyde's!\" cried Utterson. \"Down with\r\nthe door, Poole!\"\r\n\r\nPoole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and\r\nthe red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal screech,\r\nas of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the axe again,\r\nand again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four times the\r\nblow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of excellent\r\nworkmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock burst and the\r\nwreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.\r\n\r\nThe besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had\r\nsucceeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet\r\nbefore their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and\r\nchattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer\r\nor two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer\r\nthe fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you would\r\nhave said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most\r\ncommonplace that night in London.\r\n\r\nRight in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and\r\nstill twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and\r\nbeheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in clothes far too large\r\nfor him, clothes of the doctor's bigness; the cords of his face still\r\nmoved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone: and by the\r\ncrushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung\r\nupon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a\r\nself-destroyer.\r\n\r\n\"We have come too late,\" he said sternly, \"whether to save or punish.\r\nHyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the body\r\nof your master.\"\r\n\r\nThe far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre,\r\nwhich filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above,\r\nand by the cabinet, which formed an upper story at one end and looked\r\nupon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the\r\nby-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second\r\nflight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious\r\ncellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet needed but\r\na glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from their\r\ndoors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was filled with\r\ncrazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was\r\nJekyll's predecessor; but even as they opened the door they were\r\nadvertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a\r\nperfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance. No\r\nwhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll dead or alive.\r\n\r\nPoole stamped on the flags of the corridor. \"He must be buried here,\" he\r\nsaid, hearkening to the sound.\r\n\r\n\"Or he may have fled,\" said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door\r\nin the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they\r\nfound the key, already stained with rust.\r\n\r\n\"This does not look like use,\" observed the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"Use!\" echoed Poole. \"Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a\r\nman had stamped on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" continued Utterson, \"and the fractures, too, are rusty.\" The two\r\nmen looked at each other with a scare. \"This is beyond me, Poole,\" said\r\nthe lawyer. \"Let us go back to the cabinet.\"\r\n\r\nThey mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional\r\nawestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine\r\nthe contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of chemical\r\nwork, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass\r\nsaucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\n\"That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,\" said Poole; and\r\neven as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.\r\n\r\nThis brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn cosily\r\nup, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter's elbow, the very sugar\r\nin the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay beside the tea\r\nthings open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy of a pious work,\r\nfor which Jekyll had several times expressed a great esteem, annotated,\r\nin his own hand with startling blasphemies.\r\n\r\nNext, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came\r\nto the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary\r\nhorror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow\r\nplaying on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions\r\nalong the glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful\r\ncountenances stooping to look in.\r\n\r\n\"This glass has seen some strange things, sir,\" whispered Poole.\r\n\r\n\"And surely none stranger than itself,\" echoed the lawyer in the same\r\ntones. \"For what did Jekyll\"--he caught himself up at the word with a\r\nstart, and then conquering the weakness--\"what could Jekyll want with\r\nit?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You may say that!\" said Poole.\r\n\r\nNext they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat\r\narray of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the\r\ndoctor's hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and\r\nseveral enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the\r\nsame eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before,\r\nto serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case\r\nof disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer,\r\nwith indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John Utterson. He\r\nlooked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of all at the dead\r\nmalefactor stretched upon the carpet.\r\n\r\n\"My head goes round,\" he said. \"He has been all these days in\r\npossession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see\r\nhimself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.\"\r\n\r\nHe caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor's hand\r\nand dated at the top. \"O Poole!\" the lawyer cried, \"he was alive and\r\nhere this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he\r\nmust be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how?\r\nand in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must\r\nbe careful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire\r\ncatastrophe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you read it, sir?\" asked Poole.\r\n\r\n\"Because I fear,\" replied the lawyer solemnly. \"God grant I have no\r\ncause for it!\" And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"My dear Utterson,--When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have\r\ndisappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to\r\nforesee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless\r\nsituation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and\r\nfirst read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your\r\nhands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of\r\n\r\n\"Your unworthy and unhappy friend,\r\n\r\n\"HENRY JEKYLL.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a third enclosure?\" asked Utterson.\r\n\r\n\"Here, sir,\" said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet\r\nsealed in several places.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer put it in his pocket. \"I would say nothing of this paper. If\r\nyour master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is\r\nnow ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall\r\nbe back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.\"\r\n\r\nThey went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and\r\nUtterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the\r\nhall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which\r\nthis mystery was now to be explained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. LANYON'S NARRATIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening\r\ndelivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague\r\nand old school companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised by\r\nthis; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had seen\r\nthe man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could\r\nimagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of\r\nregistration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the\r\nletter ran:\r\n\r\n\"10th December, 18--.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Lanyon,--You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may\r\nhave differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at\r\nleast on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day\r\nwhen, if you had said to me, `Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason,\r\ndepend upon you,' I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you.\r\nLanyon my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you fail\r\nme to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface, that I\r\nam going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge for\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night--ay, even if\r\nyou were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless\r\nyour carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in\r\nyour hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my\r\nbutler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a\r\nlocksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced: and you are\r\nto go in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand,\r\nbreaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, with all its contents\r\nas they stand, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is the same\r\nthing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of mind, I have\r\na morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in error, you may\r\nknow the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a phial and a\r\npaper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you to Cavendish\r\nSquare exactly as it stands.\r\n\r\n\"That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should\r\nbe back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before\r\nmidnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in\r\nthe fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor\r\nforeseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be\r\npreferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to\r\nask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own hand\r\ninto the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to place\r\nin his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from my\r\ncabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude\r\ncompletely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation,\r\nyou will have understood that these arrangements are of capital\r\nimportance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they\r\nmust appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or the\r\nshipwreck of my reason.\r\n\r\n\"Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart\r\nsinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility.\r\nThink of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a\r\nblackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware\r\nthat, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away\r\nlike a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save\r\n\r\n\"Your friend,\r\n\r\n\"H.J.\r\n\r\n\"P.S.--I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my\r\nsoul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter\r\nnot come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dear\r\nLanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the\r\ncourse of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It may\r\nthen already be too late; and if that night passes without event, you\r\nwill know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane;\r\nbut till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound\r\nto do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less\r\nI was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so\r\nworded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose\r\naccordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to\r\nJekyll's house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by\r\nthe same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent\r\nat once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we\r\nwere yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman's surgical\r\ntheatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll's private\r\ncabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the lock\r\nexcellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and have\r\nto do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was near\r\ndespair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour's work,\r\nthe door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took out the\r\ndrawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and returned\r\nwith it to Cavendish Square.\r\n\r\nHere I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly enough\r\nmade up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so that it\r\nwas plain they were of Jekyll's private manufacture: and when I opened\r\none of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple crystalline salt\r\nof a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned my attention,\r\nmight have been about half full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly\r\npungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and\r\nsome volatile ether. At the other ingredients I could make no guess. The\r\nbook was an ordinary version book and contained little but a series of\r\ndates. These covered a period of many years, but I observed that the\r\nentries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly. Here and there a\r\nbrief remark was appended to a date, usually no more than a single\r\nword: \"double\" occurring perhaps six times in a total of several hundred\r\nentries; and once very early in the list and followed by several marks\r\nof exclamation, \"total failure!!!\" All this, though it whetted my\r\ncuriosity, told me little that was definite. Here were a phial of some\r\nsalt, and the record of a series of experiments that had led (like too\r\nmany of Jekyll's investigations) to no end of practical usefulness.\r\nHow could the presence of these articles in my house affect either\r\nthe honour, the sanity, or the life of my flighty colleague? If his\r\nmessenger could go to one place, why could he not go to another? And\r\neven granting some impediment, why was this gentleman to be received by\r\nme in secret? The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that I\r\nwas dealing with a case of cerebral disease; and though I dismissed my\r\nservants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I might be found in some\r\nposture of self-defence.\r\n\r\nTwelve o'clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded\r\nvery gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a small\r\nman crouching against the pillars of the portico.\r\n\r\n\"Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe told me \"yes\" by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him\r\nenter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the\r\ndarkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing\r\nwith his bull's eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor started\r\nand made greater haste.\r\n\r\nThese particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed\r\nhim into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready\r\non my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I had\r\nnever set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as\r\nI have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his\r\nface, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and\r\ngreat apparent debility of constitution, and--last but not least--with\r\nthe odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore\r\nsome resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked\r\nsinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic,\r\npersonal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the symptoms;\r\nbut I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in\r\nthe nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle\r\nof hatred.\r\n\r\nThis person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance, struck\r\nin me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was dressed\r\nin a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable; his\r\nclothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober fabric,\r\nwere enormously too large for him in every measurement--the trousers\r\nhanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the ground, the\r\nwaist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar sprawling wide upon\r\nhis shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous accoutrement was far\r\nfrom moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was something abnormal\r\nand misbegotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced\r\nme--something seizing, surprising and revolting--this fresh disparity\r\nseemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that to my interest\r\nin the man's nature and character, there was added a curiosity as to his\r\norigin, his life, his fortune and status in the world.\r\n\r\nThese observations, though they have taken so great a space to be set\r\ndown in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was, indeed, on\r\nfire with sombre excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Have you got it?\" he cried. \"Have you got it?\" And so lively was his\r\nimpatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my\r\nblood. \"Come, sir,\" said I. \"You forget that I have not yet the pleasure\r\nof your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.\" And I showed him an\r\nexample, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as fair an\r\nimitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness of the\r\nhour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of my\r\nvisitor, would suffer me to muster.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,\" he replied civilly enough. \"What you\r\nsay is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my\r\npoliteness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry\r\nJekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood...\" He\r\npaused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his\r\ncollected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the\r\nhysteria--\"I understood, a drawer...\"\r\n\r\nBut here I took pity on my visitor's suspense, and some perhaps on my\r\nown growing curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"There it is, sir,\" said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the\r\nfloor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart: I\r\ncould hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and\r\nhis face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life and\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n\"Compose yourself,\" said I.\r\n\r\nHe turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of\r\ndespair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he uttered\r\none loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified. And the next\r\nmoment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, \"Have you\r\na graduated glass?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nI rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nHe thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red\r\ntincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which was at first\r\nof a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to\r\nbrighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes\r\nof vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and\r\nthe compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to\r\na watery green. My visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a\r\nkeen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned and\r\nlooked upon me with an air of scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said he, \"to settle what remains. Will you be wise? will you\r\nbe guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to\r\ngo forth from your house without further parley? or has the greed of\r\ncuriosity too much command of you? Think before you answer, for it shall\r\nbe done as you decide. As you decide, you shall be left as you were\r\nbefore, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service\r\nrendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches\r\nof the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of\r\nknowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you,\r\nhere, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted by\r\na prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly\r\npossessing, \"you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I\r\nhear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I have gone too\r\nfar in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well,\" replied my visitor. \"Lanyon, you remember your vows: what\r\nfollows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have so\r\nlong been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have\r\ndenied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your\r\nsuperiors--behold!\"\r\n\r\nHe put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed;\r\nhe reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with\r\ninjected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I\r\nthought, a change--he seemed to swell--his face became suddenly black\r\nand the features seemed to melt and alter--and the next moment, I had\r\nsprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to\r\nshield me from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.\r\n\r\n\"O God!\" I screamed, and \"O God!\" again and again; for there before my\r\neyes--pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with\r\nhis hands, like a man restored from death--there stood Henry Jekyll!\r\n\r\nWhat he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on\r\npaper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at\r\nit; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if\r\nI believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots; sleep\r\nhas left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the day and\r\nnight; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must die;\r\nand yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that man\r\nunveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I can not, even in\r\nmemory, dwell on it without a start of horror. I will say but one thing,\r\nUtterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it) will be\r\nmore than enough. The creature who crept into my house that night was,\r\non Jekyll's own confession, known by the name of Hyde and hunted for in\r\nevery corner of the land as the murderer of Carew.\r\n\r\nHASTIE LANYON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY JEKYLL'S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born in the year 18-- to a large fortune, endowed besides with\r\nexcellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect\r\nof the wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been\r\nsupposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished\r\nfuture. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient gaiety\r\nof disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such as I\r\nfound it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head\r\nhigh, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public.\r\nHence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that when I\r\nreached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take stock\r\nof my progress and position in the world, I stood already committed to\r\na profound duplicity of me. Many a man would have even blazoned such\r\nirregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high views that I had\r\nset before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost morbid sense of\r\nshame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any\r\nparticular degradation in my faults, that made me what I was, and, with\r\neven a deeper trench than in the majority of men, severed in me those\r\nprovinces of good and ill which divide and compound man's dual nature.\r\nIn this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that\r\nhard law of life, which lies at the root of religion and is one of the\r\nmost plentiful springs of distress. Though so profound a double-dealer,\r\nI was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me were in dead earnest;\r\nI was no more myself when I laid aside restraint and plunged in shame,\r\nthan when I laboured, in the eye of day, at the furtherance of knowledge\r\nor the relief of sorrow and suffering. And it chanced that the direction\r\nof my scientific studies, which led wholly towards the mystic and the\r\ntranscendental, reacted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of\r\nthe perennial war among my members. With every day, and from both sides\r\nof my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily\r\nnearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to\r\nsuch a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I\r\nsay two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that\r\npoint. Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines;\r\nand I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere\r\npolity of multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my\r\npart, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction\r\nand in one direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own\r\nperson, that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality\r\nof man; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my\r\nconsciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only\r\nbecause I was radically both; and from an early date, even before the\r\ncourse of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked\r\npossibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with pleasure, as\r\na beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of these elements.\r\nIf each, I told myself, could be housed in separate identities, life\r\nwould be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust might go his\r\nway, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright\r\ntwin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward\r\npath, doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no\r\nlonger exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous\r\nevil. It was the curse of mankind that these incongruous faggots were\r\nthus bound together--that in the agonised womb of consciousness, these\r\npolar twins should be continuously struggling. How, then were they\r\ndissociated?\r\n\r\nI was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began\r\nto shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to\r\nperceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling\r\nimmateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body\r\nin which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to\r\nshake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss\r\nthe curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter\r\ndeeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I\r\nhave been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound\r\nfor ever on man's shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast\r\nit off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful\r\npressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too evident,\r\nmy discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only recognised\r\nmy natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the\r\npowers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by which\r\nthese powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a second form\r\nand countenance substituted, none the less natural to me because they\r\nwere the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements in my soul.\r\n\r\nI hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice. I\r\nknew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled\r\nand shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of\r\nan overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition,\r\nutterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to\r\nchange. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at\r\nlast overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my\r\ntincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a\r\nlarge quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments,\r\nto be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I\r\ncompounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the\r\nglass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of\r\ncourage, drank off the potion.\r\n\r\nThe most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly\r\nnausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour\r\nof birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and\r\nI came to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something\r\nstrange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its very\r\nnovelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in body;\r\nwithin I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of disordered\r\nsensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a solution of the\r\nbonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul.\r\nI knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked,\r\ntenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my original evil; and the thought,\r\nin that moment, braced and delighted me like wine. I stretched out my\r\nhands, exulting in the freshness of these sensations; and in the act, I\r\nwas suddenly aware that I had lost in stature.\r\n\r\nThere was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside\r\nme as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose\r\nof these transformations. The night however, was far gone into\r\nthe morning--the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the\r\nconception of the day--the inmates of my house were locked in the most\r\nrigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with\r\nhope and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom.\r\nI crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I\r\ncould have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that\r\ntheir unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through\r\nthe corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw\r\nfor the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.\r\n\r\nI must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but\r\nthat which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature, to\r\nwhich I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust and\r\nless developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in the\r\ncourse of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of\r\neffort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much\r\nless exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde\r\nwas so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as\r\ngood shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly\r\nand plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still\r\nbelieve to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint\r\nof deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the\r\nglass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome.\r\nThis, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes it bore\r\na livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and single, than\r\nthe imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto accustomed\r\nto call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have observed that\r\nwhen I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come near to me at\r\nfirst without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as I take it, was\r\nbecause all human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good\r\nand evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil.\r\n\r\nI lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive\r\nexperiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had\r\nlost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a\r\nhouse that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I\r\nonce more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs\r\nof dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the\r\nstature and the face of Henry Jekyll.\r\n\r\nThat night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my\r\ndiscovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while\r\nunder the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been\r\notherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth\r\nan angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action;\r\nit was neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the\r\nprisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that\r\nwhich stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my evil,\r\nkept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion; and\r\nthe thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence, although I had now\r\ntwo characters as well as two appearances, one was wholly evil, and the\r\nother was still the old Henry Jekyll, that incongruous compound of\r\nwhose reformation and improvement I had already learned to despair. The\r\nmovement was thus wholly toward the worse.\r\n\r\nEven at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of\r\na life of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my\r\npleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well\r\nknown and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this\r\nincoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this\r\nside that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to\r\ndrink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to\r\nassume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the notion;\r\nit seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my preparations\r\nwith the most studious care. I took and furnished that house in Soho,\r\nto which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as a housekeeper\r\na creature whom I knew well to be silent and unscrupulous. On the other\r\nside, I announced to my servants that a Mr. Hyde (whom I described)\r\nwas to have full liberty and power about my house in the square; and to\r\nparry mishaps, I even called and made myself a familiar object, in\r\nmy second character. I next drew up that will to which you so much\r\nobjected; so that if anything befell me in the person of Dr. Jekyll,\r\nI could enter on that of Edward Hyde without pecuniary loss. And thus\r\nfortified, as I supposed, on every side, I began to profit by the\r\nstrange immunities of my position.\r\n\r\nMen have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own\r\nperson and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did\r\nso for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eye\r\nwith a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy,\r\nstrip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty.\r\nBut for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was complete. Think\r\nof it--I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my laboratory door,\r\ngive me but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that I had\r\nalways standing ready; and whatever he had done, Edward Hyde would pass\r\naway like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and there in his stead,\r\nquietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his study, a man who\r\ncould afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry Jekyll.\r\n\r\nThe pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have\r\nsaid, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands of\r\nEdward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I would\r\ncome back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind of\r\nwonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out of\r\nmy own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being\r\ninherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on\r\nself; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture\r\nto another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at times\r\naghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from\r\nordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was\r\nHyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse;\r\nhe woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even\r\nmake haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And\r\nthus his conscience slumbered.\r\n\r\nInto the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now\r\nI can scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I\r\nmean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which\r\nmy chastisement approached. I met with one accident which, as it brought\r\non no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of cruelty to a\r\nchild aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I recognised\r\nthe other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and the child's\r\nfamily joined him; there were moments when I feared for my life; and at\r\nlast, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward Hyde had to\r\nbring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of\r\nHenry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by\r\nopening an account at another bank in the name of Edward Hyde himself;\r\nand when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied my double with\r\na signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.\r\n\r\nSome two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for one\r\nof my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next day in\r\nbed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked about me; in\r\nvain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room in the\r\nsquare; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed curtains and\r\nthe design of the mahogany frame; something still kept insisting that I\r\nwas not where I was, that I had not wakened where I seemed to be, but in\r\nthe little room in Soho where I was accustomed to sleep in the body\r\nof Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my psychological way, began\r\nlazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion, occasionally, even\r\nas I did so, dropping back into a comfortable morning doze. I was still\r\nso engaged when, in one of my more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon\r\nmy hand. Now the hand of Henry Jekyll (as you have often remarked) was\r\nprofessional in shape and size: it was large, firm, white and comely.\r\nBut the hand which I now saw, clearly enough, in the yellow light of a\r\nmid-London morning, lying half shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corder,\r\nknuckly, of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of\r\nhair. It was the hand of Edward Hyde.\r\n\r\nI must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the\r\nmere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden\r\nand startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I rushed\r\nto the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was changed into\r\nsomething exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed Henry Jekyll,\r\nI had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained? I asked\r\nmyself; and then, with another bound of terror--how was it to be\r\nremedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my\r\ndrugs were in the cabinet--a long journey down two pairs of stairs,\r\nthrough the back passage, across the open court and through the\r\nanatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It\r\nmight indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that,\r\nwhen I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And then with\r\nan overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind that the\r\nservants were already used to the coming and going of my second self. I\r\nhad soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of my own size: had\r\nsoon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared and drew back at\r\nseeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange array; and ten\r\nminutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape and was sitting\r\ndown, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting.\r\n\r\nSmall indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal\r\nof my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the\r\nwall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to\r\nreflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities\r\nof my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of\r\nprojecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed\r\nto me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature, as\r\nthough (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous tide\r\nof blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much prolonged,\r\nthe balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown, the power of\r\nvoluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward Hyde become\r\nirrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always equally\r\ndisplayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed me;\r\nsince then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double, and\r\nonce, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these rare\r\nuncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment.\r\nNow, however, and in the light of that morning's accident, I was led to\r\nremark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to\r\nthrow off the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly\r\ntransferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to\r\npoint to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better\r\nself, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse.\r\n\r\nBetween these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had memory\r\nin common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared\r\nbetween them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive\r\napprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the\r\npleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll, or\r\nbut remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in\r\nwhich he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father's\r\ninterest; Hyde had more than a son's indifference. To cast in my lot\r\nwith Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly\r\nindulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was\r\nto die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a blow\r\nand forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear unequal;\r\nbut there was still another consideration in the scales; for while\r\nJekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde would be\r\nnot even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my circumstances\r\nwere, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man;\r\nmuch the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and\r\ntrembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with so vast\r\na majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was found\r\nwanting in the strength to keep to it.\r\n\r\nYes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by\r\nfriends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to\r\nthe liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses\r\nand secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. I made\r\nthis choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I neither\r\ngave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward Hyde,\r\nwhich still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I was true\r\nto my determination; for two months, I led a life of such severity as\r\nI had never before attained to, and enjoyed the compensations of an\r\napproving conscience. But time began at last to obliterate the freshness\r\nof my alarm; the praises of conscience began to grow into a thing of\r\ncourse; I began to be tortured with throes and longings, as of Hyde\r\nstruggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour of moral weakness, I\r\nonce again compounded and swallowed the transforming draught.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his\r\nvice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that\r\nhe runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I, long\r\nas I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the complete\r\nmoral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which were the\r\nleading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I was\r\npunished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was\r\nconscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more\r\nfurious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that\r\nstirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to\r\nthe civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God, no\r\nman morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a\r\nprovocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in\r\nwhich a sick child may break a plaything. But I had voluntarily stripped\r\nmyself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us\r\ncontinues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations; and\r\nin my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall.\r\n\r\nInstantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport of\r\nglee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow;\r\nand it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was suddenly,\r\nin the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a cold thrill\r\nof terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit; and fled from\r\nthe scene of these excesses, at once glorying and trembling, my lust of\r\nevil gratified and stimulated, my love of life screwed to the topmost\r\npeg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make assurance doubly sure)\r\ndestroyed my papers; thence I set out through the lamplit streets, in\r\nthe same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on my crime, light-headedly\r\ndevising others in the future, and yet still hastening and still\r\nhearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger. Hyde had a song upon\r\nhis lips as he compounded the draught, and as he drank it, pledged the\r\ndead man. The pangs of transformation had not done tearing him, before\r\nHenry Jekyll, with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had\r\nfallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped hands to God. The veil of\r\nself-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I saw my life as a whole:\r\nI followed it up from the days of childhood, when I had walked with my\r\nfather's hand, and through the self-denying toils of my professional\r\nlife, to arrive again and again, with the same sense of unreality, at\r\nthe damned horrors of the evening. I could have screamed aloud; I sought\r\nwith tears and prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous images and\r\nsounds with which my memory swarmed against me; and still, between the\r\npetitions, the ugly face of my iniquity stared into my soul. As the\r\nacuteness of this remorse began to die away, it was succeeded by a\r\nsense of joy. The problem of my conduct was solved. Hyde was thenceforth\r\nimpossible; whether I would or not, I was now confined to the better\r\npart of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced to think of it! with what\r\nwilling humility I embraced anew the restrictions of natural life! with\r\nwhat sincere renunciation I locked the door by which I had so often gone\r\nand come, and ground the key under my heel!\r\n\r\nThe next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked,\r\nthat the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was\r\na man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been a\r\ntragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have\r\nmy better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the\r\nscaffold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an\r\ninstant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.\r\n\r\nI resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with\r\nhonesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself how\r\nearnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to relieve\r\nsuffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the days\r\npassed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say that I\r\nwearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead that I\r\ndaily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my duality\r\nof purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the lower\r\nside of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to growl\r\nfor licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare idea of\r\nthat would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person that I\r\nwas once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was as\r\nan ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of\r\ntemptation.\r\n\r\nThere comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled\r\nat last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the\r\nbalance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural,\r\nlike a return to the old days before I had made my discovery. It was a\r\nfine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted, but\r\ncloudless overhead; and the Regent's Park was full of winter chirrupings\r\nand sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench; the animal\r\nwithin me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a little\r\ndrowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to begin.\r\nAfter all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I smiled,\r\ncomparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will with\r\nthe lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that\r\nvainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the most\r\ndeadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then as\r\nin its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in\r\nthe temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger,\r\na solution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung\r\nformlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was corded\r\nand hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde. A moment before I had been safe\r\nof all men's respect, wealthy, beloved--the cloth laying for me in the\r\ndining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of mankind, hunted,\r\nhouseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows.\r\n\r\nMy reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than once\r\nobserved that in my second character, my faculties seemed sharpened to\r\na point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came about that,\r\nwhere Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the importance\r\nof the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of my cabinet; how\r\nwas I to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing my temples in\r\nmy hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I had closed. If\r\nI sought to enter by the house, my own servants would consign me to the\r\ngallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and thought of Lanyon. How\r\nwas he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing that I escaped capture in\r\nthe streets, how was I to make my way into his presence? and how should\r\nI, an unknown and displeasing visitor, prevail on the famous physician\r\nto rifle the study of his colleague, Dr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that\r\nof my original character, one part remained to me: I could write my own\r\nhand; and once I had conceived that kindling spark, the way that I must\r\nfollow became lighted up from end to end.\r\n\r\nThereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a\r\npassing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of\r\nwhich I chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical\r\nenough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could\r\nnot conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of\r\ndevilish fury; and the smile withered from his face--happily for\r\nhim--yet more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly\r\ndragged him from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me\r\nwith so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look\r\ndid they exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders,\r\nled me to a private room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde\r\nin danger of his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate\r\nanger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the\r\ncreature was astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will;\r\ncomposed his two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and\r\nthat he might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them\r\nout with directions that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he\r\nsat all day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there\r\nhe dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing\r\nbefore his eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth\r\nin the corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the\r\nstreets of the city. He, I say--I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had\r\nnothing human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at\r\nlast, thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged\r\nthe cab and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an\r\nobject marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal\r\npassengers, these two base passions raged within him like a tempest.\r\nHe walked fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking\r\nthrough the less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that\r\nstill divided him from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I\r\nthink, a box of lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to myself at Lanyon's, the horror of my old friend perhaps\r\naffected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in\r\nthe sea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours. A\r\nchange had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows,\r\nit was the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyon's\r\ncondemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came\r\nhome to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration\r\nof the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the\r\nnightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morning\r\nshaken, weakened, but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thought\r\nof the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten the\r\nappalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home, in my\r\nown house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape shone so\r\nstrong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of hope.\r\n\r\nI was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking\r\nthe chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those\r\nindescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the\r\ntime to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging\r\nand freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion a\r\ndouble dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat\r\nlooking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be\r\nre-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a great\r\neffort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation of the\r\ndrug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all hours of\r\nthe day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory shudder; above\r\nall, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always\r\nas Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this continually impending\r\ndoom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself, ay, even\r\nbeyond what I had thought possible to man, I became, in my own person, a\r\ncreature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and\r\nmind, and solely occupied by one thought: the horror of my other self.\r\nBut when I slept, or when the virtue of the medicine wore off, I would\r\nleap almost without transition (for the pangs of transformation grew\r\ndaily less marked) into the possession of a fancy brimming with images\r\nof terror, a soul boiling with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed\r\nnot strong enough to contain the raging energies of life. The powers of\r\nHyde seemed to have grown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly\r\nthe hate that now divided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it\r\nwas a thing of vital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity\r\nof that creature that shared with him some of the phenomena of\r\nconsciousness, and was co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links\r\nof community, which in themselves made the most poignant part of\r\nhis distress, he thought of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of\r\nsomething not only hellish but inorganic. This was the shocking thing;\r\nthat the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices; that the\r\namorphous dust gesticulated and sinned; that what was dead, and had\r\nno shape, should usurp the offices of life. And this again, that that\r\ninsurgent horror was knit to him closer than a wife, closer than an eye;\r\nlay caged in his flesh, where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle\r\nto be born; and at every hour of weakness, and in the confidence of\r\nslumber, prevailed against him, and deposed him out of life. The hatred\r\nof Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order. His terror of the gallows\r\ndrove him continually to commit temporary suicide, and return to his\r\nsubordinate station of a part instead of a person; but he loathed the\r\nnecessity, he loathed the despondency into which Jekyll was now fallen,\r\nand he resented the dislike with which he was himself regarded. Hence\r\nthe ape-like tricks that he would play me, scrawling in my own hand\r\nblasphemies on the pages of my books, burning the letters and destroying\r\nthe portrait of my father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of\r\ndeath, he would long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in\r\nthe ruin. But his love of me is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken\r\nand freeze at the mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and\r\npassion of this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut\r\nhim off by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him.\r\n\r\nIt is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this\r\ndescription; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice;\r\nand yet even to these, habit brought--no, not alleviation--but a\r\ncertain callousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my\r\npunishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity which\r\nhas now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face and\r\nnature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed since the\r\ndate of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent out for a fresh\r\nsupply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and the first\r\nchange of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was without\r\nefficiency. You will learn from Poole how I have had London ransacked;\r\nit was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply was impure,\r\nand that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy to the\r\ndraught.\r\n\r\nAbout a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement under the\r\ninfluence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last time,\r\nshort of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughts or see\r\nhis own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must I delay\r\ntoo long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has hitherto\r\nescaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great prudence\r\nand great good luck. Should the throes of change take me in the act of\r\nwriting it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time shall\r\nhave elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness and\r\ncircumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from the\r\naction of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing on us\r\nboth has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now, when\r\nI shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I know how I\r\nshall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with the most\r\nstrained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and down this\r\nroom (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of menace.\r\nWill Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage to release\r\nhimself at the last moment? God knows; I am careless; this is my true\r\nhour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than myself. Here\r\nthen, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my confession, I\r\nbring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr.\r\nHyde, by Robert Louis Stevenson\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 43.txt or 43.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/43/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

W\u00e4hrend es sich fr\u00fcher gut lohnte, gro\u00dfe derartige\r\nVorf\u00fchrungen in eigener Regie zu veranstalten, ist dies heute v\u00f6llig\r\nunm\u00f6glich. Es waren andere Zeiten. Damals besch\u00e4ftigte sich die ganze\r\nStadt mit dem Hungerk\u00fcnstler; von Hungertag zu Hungertag stieg die\r\nTeilnahme; jeder wollte den Hungerk\u00fcnstler zumindest einmal t\u00e4glich\r\nsehn; an den sp\u00e4tern Tagen gab es Abonnenten, welche tagelang vor dem\r\nkleinen Gitterk\u00e4fig sa\u00dfen; auch in der Nacht fanden Besichtigungen\r\nstatt, zur Erh\u00f6hung der Wirkung bei Fackelschein; an sch\u00f6nen Tagen wurde\r\nder K\u00e4fig ins Freie getragen, und nun waren es besonders die Kinder,\r\ndenen der Hungerk\u00fcnstler gezeigt wurde; w\u00e4hrend er f\u00fcr die Erwachsenen\r\noft nur ein Spa\u00df war, an dem sie der Mode halber teilnahmen, sahen die\r\nKinder staunend, mit offenem Mund, der Sicherheit halber einander bei\r\nder Hand haltend, zu, wie er bleich, im schwarzen Trikot, mit m\u00e4chtig\r\nvortretenden Rippen, sogar einen Sessel verschm\u00e4hend, auf hingestreutem\r\nStroh sa\u00df, einmal h\u00f6flich nickend, angestrengt l\u00e4chelnd Fragen\r\nbeantwortete, auch durch das Gitter den Arm streckte, um seine\r\nMagerkeit bef\u00fchlen zu lassen, dann aber wieder ganz in sich selbst\r\nversank, um niemanden sich k\u00fcmmerte, nicht einmal um den f\u00fcr ihn so\r\nwichtigen Schlag der Uhr, die das einzige M\u00f6belst\u00fcck des K\u00e4figs war,\r\nsondern nur vor sich hinsah mit fast geschlossenen Augen und hie und da\r\naus einem winzigen Gl\u00e4schen Wasser nippte, um sich die Lippen zu\r\nfeuchten.\r\n\r\nAu\u00dfer den wechselnden Zuschauern waren auch st\u00e4ndige, vom Publikum\r\ngew\u00e4hlte W\u00e4chter da, merkw\u00fcrdigerweise gew\u00f6hnlich Fleischhauer,\r\nwelche, immer drei gleichzeitig, die Aufgabe hatten, Tag und Nacht\r\nden Hungerk\u00fcnstler zu beobachten, damit er nicht etwa auf irgendeine\r\nheimliche Weise doch Nahrung zu sich nehme. Es war das aber lediglich\r\neine Formalit\u00e4t, eingef\u00fchrt zur Beruhigung der Massen, denn die\r\nEingeweihten wu\u00dften wohl, da\u00df der Hungerk\u00fcnstler w\u00e4hrend der Hungerzeit\r\nniemals, unter keinen Umst\u00e4nden, selbst unter Zwang nicht, auch das\r\nGeringste nur gegessen h\u00e4tte; die Ehre seiner Kunst verbot dies.\r\nFreilich, nicht jeder W\u00e4chter konnte das begreifen, es fanden sich\r\nmanchmal n\u00e4chtliche Wachgruppen, welche die Bewachung sehr lax\r\ndurchf\u00fchrten, absichtlich in eine ferne Ecke sich zusammensetzten und\r\ndort sich ins Kartenspiel vertieften, in der offenbaren Absicht, dem\r\nHungerk\u00fcnstler eine kleine Erfrischung zu g\u00f6nnen, die er ihrer Meinung\r\nnach aus irgendwelchen geheimen Vorr\u00e4ten hervorholen konnte. Nichts\r\nwar dem Hungerk\u00fcnstler qu\u00e4lender als solche W\u00e4chter; sie machten ihn\r\ntr\u00fcbselig; sie machten ihm das Hungern entsetzlich schwer; manchmal\r\n\u00fcberwand er seine Schw\u00e4che und sang w\u00e4hrend dieser Wachzeit, solange\r\ner es nur aushielt, um den Leuten zu zeigen, wie ungerecht sie ihn\r\nverd\u00e4chtigten. Doch half das wenig; sie wunderten sich dann nur \u00fcber\r\nseine Geschicklichkeit, selbst w\u00e4hrend des Singens zu essen. Viel lieber\r\nwaren ihm die W\u00e4chter, welche sich eng zum Gitter setzten, mit der\r\ntr\u00fcben Nachtbeleuchtung des Saales sich nicht begn\u00fcgten, sondern ihn mit\r\nden elektrischen Taschenlampen bestrahlten, die ihnen der Impresario\r\nzur Verf\u00fcgung stellte. Das grelle Licht st\u00f6rte ihn gar nicht, schlafen\r\nkonnte er ja \u00fcberhaupt nicht und ein wenig hind\u00e4mmern konnte er immer,\r\nbei jeder Beleuchtung und zu jeder Stunde, auch im \u00fcbervollen, l\u00e4rmenden\r\nSaal. Er war sehr gerne bereit, mit solchen W\u00e4chtern die Nacht g\u00e4nzlich\r\nohne Schlaf zu verbringen; er war bereit, mit ihnen zu scherzen, ihnen\r\nGeschichten aus seinem Wanderleben zu erz\u00e4hlen, dann wieder ihre\r\nErz\u00e4hlungen anzuh\u00f6ren, alles nur um sie wachzuhalten, um ihnen immer\r\nwieder zeigen zu k\u00f6nnen, da\u00df er nichts E\u00dfbares im K\u00e4fig hatte und da\u00df\r\ner hungerte, wie keiner von ihnen es k\u00f6nnte. Am gl\u00fccklichsten aber war\r\ner, wenn dann der Morgen kam, und ihnen auf seine Rechnung ein\r\n\u00fcberreiches Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck gebracht wurde, auf das sie sich warfen mit dem\r\nAppetit gesunder M\u00e4nner nach einer m\u00fchevoll durchwachten Nacht. Es\r\ngab zwar sogar Leute, die in diesem Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck eine ungeb\u00fchrliche\r\nBeeinflussung der W\u00e4chter sehen wollten, aber das ging doch zu weit, und\r\nwenn man sie fragte, ob etwa sie nur um der Sache willen ohne Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck\r\ndie Nachtwache \u00fcbernehmen wollten, verzogen sie sich, aber bei ihren\r\nVerd\u00e4chtigungen blieben sie dennoch.\r\n\r\nDieses allerdings geh\u00f6rte schon zu den vom Hungern \u00fcberhaupt nicht zu\r\ntrennenden Verd\u00e4chtigungen. Niemand war ja imstande, alle die Tage und\r\nN\u00e4chte beim Hungerk\u00fcnstler ununterbrochen als W\u00e4chter zu verbringen,\r\nniemand also konnte aus eigener Anschauung wissen, ob wirklich\r\nununterbrochen, fehlerlos gehungert worden war; nur der Hungerk\u00fcnstler\r\nselbst konnte das wissen, nur er also gleichzeitig der von seinem\r\nHungern vollkommen befriedigte Zuschauer sein. Er aber war wieder aus\r\neinem andern Grunde niemals befriedigt; vielleicht war er gar nicht\r\nvom Hungern so sehr abgemagert, da\u00df manche zu ihrem Bedauern den\r\nVorf\u00fchrungen fern bleiben mu\u00dften, weil sie seinen Anblick nicht\r\nertrugen, sondern er war nur so abgemagert aus Unzufriedenheit mit sich\r\nselbst. Er allein n\u00e4mlich wu\u00dfte, auch kein Eingeweihter sonst wu\u00dfte das,\r\nwie leicht das Hungern war. Es war die leichteste Sache von der Welt.\r\nEr verschwieg es auch nicht, aber man glaubte ihm nicht, hielt ihn\r\ng\u00fcnstigstenfalls f\u00fcr bescheiden, meist aber f\u00fcr reklames\u00fcchtig oder gar\r\nf\u00fcr einen Schwindler, dem das Hungern allerdings leicht war, weil er es\r\nsich leicht zu machen verstand, und der auch noch die Stirn hatte, es\r\nhalb zu gestehn. Das alles mu\u00dfte er hinnehmen, hatte sich auch im Laufe\r\nder Jahre daran gew\u00f6hnt, aber innerlich nagte diese Unbefriedigtheit\r\nimmer an ihm, und noch niemals, nach keiner Hungerperiode -- dieses\r\nZeugnis mu\u00dfte man ihm ausstellen -- hatte er freiwillig den K\u00e4fig\r\nverlassen. Als H\u00f6chstzeit f\u00fcr das Hungern hatte der Impresario vierzig\r\nTage festgesetzt, dar\u00fcber hinaus lie\u00df er niemals hungern, auch in den\r\nWeltst\u00e4dten nicht, und zwar aus gutem Grund. Vierzig Tage etwa konnte\r\nman erfahrungsgem\u00e4\u00df durch allm\u00e4hlich sich steigernde Reklame das\r\nInteresse einer Stadt immer mehr aufstacheln, dann aber versagte das\r\nPublikum, eine wesentliche Abnahme des Zuspruches war festzustellen;\r\nes bestanden nat\u00fcrlich in dieser Hinsicht kleine Unterschiede zwischen\r\nden St\u00e4dten und L\u00e4ndern, als Regel aber galt, da\u00df vierzig Tage die\r\nH\u00f6chstzeit war. Dann also am vierzigsten Tage wurde die T\u00fcr des mit\r\nBlumen umkr\u00e4nzten K\u00e4figs ge\u00f6ffnet, eine begeisterte Zuschauerschaft\r\nerf\u00fcllte das Amphitheater, eine Milit\u00e4rkapelle spielte, zwei \u00c4rzte\r\nbetraten den K\u00e4fig, um die n\u00f6tigen Messungen am Hungerk\u00fcnstler\r\nvorzunehmen, durch ein Megaphon wurden die Resultate dem Saale\r\nverk\u00fcndet, und schlie\u00dflich kamen zwei junge Damen, gl\u00fccklich dar\u00fcber,\r\nda\u00df gerade sie ausgelost worden waren, und wollten den Hungerk\u00fcnstler\r\naus dem K\u00e4fig ein paar Stufen hinabf\u00fchren, wo auf einem kleinen\r\nTischchen eine sorgf\u00e4ltig ausgew\u00e4hlte Krankenmahlzeit serviert war. Und\r\nin diesem Augenblick wehrte sich der Hungerk\u00fcnstler immer. Zwar legte\r\ner noch freiwillig seine Knochenarme in die hilfsbereit ausgestreckten\r\nH\u00e4nde der zu ihm hinabgebeugten Damen, aber aufstehen wollte er nicht.\r\nWarum jetzt gerade nach vierzig Tagen aufh\u00f6ren? Er h\u00e4tte es noch lange,\r\nunbeschr\u00e4nkt lange ausgehalten; warum gerade jetzt aufh\u00f6ren, wo er im\r\nbesten, ja noch nicht einmal im besten Hungern war? Warum wollte man\r\nihn des Ruhmes berauben, weiter zu hungern, nicht nur der gr\u00f6\u00dfte\r\nHungerk\u00fcnstler aller Zeiten zu werden, der er ja wahrscheinlich schon\r\nwar, aber auch noch sich selbst zu \u00fcbertreffen bis ins Unbegreifliche,\r\ndenn f\u00fcr seine F\u00e4higkeit zu hungern f\u00fchlte er keine Grenzen. Warum hatte\r\ndiese Menge, die ihn so sehr zu bewundern vorgab, so wenig Geduld mit\r\nihm; wenn er es aushielt, noch weiter zu hungern, warum wollte sie es\r\nnicht aushalten? Auch war er m\u00fcde, sa\u00df gut im Stroh und sollte sich nun\r\nhoch und lang aufrichten und zu dem Essen gehn, das ihm schon allein\r\nin der Vorstellung \u00dcbelkeiten verursachte, deren \u00c4u\u00dferung er nur mit\r\nR\u00fccksicht auf die Damen m\u00fchselig unterdr\u00fcckte. Und er blickte empor in\r\ndie Augen der scheinbar so freundlichen, in Wirklichkeit so grausamen\r\nDamen und sch\u00fcttelte den auf dem schwachen Halse \u00fcberschweren Kopf. Aber\r\ndann geschah, was immer geschah. Der Impresario kam, hob stumm -- die\r\nMusik machte das Reden unm\u00f6glich -- die Arme \u00fcber dem Hungerk\u00fcnstler,\r\nso als lade er den Himmel ein, sich sein Werk hier auf dem Stroh einmal\r\nanzusehn, diesen bedauernswerten M\u00e4rtyrer, welcher der Hungerk\u00fcnstler\r\nallerdings war, nur in ganz anderem Sinn; fa\u00dfte den Hungerk\u00fcnstler um\r\ndie d\u00fcnne Taille, wobei er durch \u00fcbertriebene Vorsicht glaubhaft machen\r\nwollte, mit einem wie gebrechlichen Ding er es hier zu tun habe; und\r\n\u00fcbergab ihn -- nicht ohne ihn im geheimen ein wenig zu sch\u00fctteln, so da\u00df\r\nder Hungerk\u00fcnstler mit den Beinen und dem Oberk\u00f6rper unbeherrscht hin\r\nund her schwankte -- den inzwischen totenbleich gewordenen Damen. Nun\r\nduldete der Hungerk\u00fcnstler alles; der Kopf lag auf der Brust, es war,\r\nals sei er hingerollt und halte sich dort unerkl\u00e4rlich; der Leib war\r\nausgeh\u00f6hlt; die Beine dr\u00fcckten sich im Selbsterhaltungstrieb fest in den\r\nKnien aneinander, scharrten aber doch den Boden, so als sei es nicht der\r\nwirkliche, den wirklichen suchten sie erst; und die ganze, allerdings\r\nsehr kleine Last des K\u00f6rpers lag auf einer der Damen, welche\r\nhilfesuchend, mit fliegendem Atem -- so hatte sie sich dieses Ehrenamt\r\nnicht vorgestellt -- zuerst den Hals m\u00f6glichst streckte, um wenigstens\r\ndas Gesicht vor der Ber\u00fchrung mit dem Hungerk\u00fcnstler zu bewahren, dann\r\naber, da ihr dies nicht gelang und ihre gl\u00fccklichere Gef\u00e4hrtin ihr nicht\r\nzu Hilfe kam, sondern sich damit begn\u00fcgte, zitternd die Hand des\r\nHungerk\u00fcnstlers, dieses kleine Knochenb\u00fcndel, vor sich herzutragen,\r\nunter dem entz\u00fcckten Gel\u00e4chter des Saales in Weinen ausbrach und von\r\neinem l\u00e4ngst bereitgestellten Diener abgel\u00f6st werden mu\u00dfte. Dann kam\r\ndas Essen, von dem der Impresario dem Hungerk\u00fcnstler w\u00e4hrend eines\r\nohnmacht\u00e4hnlichen Halbschlafes ein wenig einfl\u00f6\u00dfte, unter lustigem\r\nPlaudern, das die Aufmerksamkeit vom Zustand des Hungerk\u00fcnstlers\r\nablenken sollte; dann wurde noch ein Trinkspruch auf das Publikum\r\nausgebracht, welcher dem Impresario angeblich vom Hungerk\u00fcnstler\r\nzugefl\u00fcstert worden war; das Orchester bekr\u00e4ftigte alles durch einen\r\ngro\u00dfen Tusch; man ging auseinander und niemand hatte das Recht, mit dem\r\nGesehenen unzufrieden zu sein, niemand, nur der Hungerk\u00fcnstler, immer\r\nnur er.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo lebte er mit regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen kleinen Ruhepausen viele Jahre, in\r\nscheinbarem Glanz, von der Welt geehrt, bei alledem aber meist in tr\u00fcber\r\nLaune, die immer noch tr\u00fcber wurde dadurch, da\u00df niemand sie ernst zu\r\nnehmen verstand. Womit sollte man ihn auch tr\u00f6sten? Was blieb ihm zu\r\nw\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig? Und wenn sich einmal ein Gutm\u00fctiger fand, der ihn\r\nbedauerte und ihm erkl\u00e4ren wollte, da\u00df seine Traurigkeit wahrscheinlich\r\nvon dem Hungern k\u00e4me, konnte es, besonders bei vorgeschrittener\r\nHungerzeit, geschehn, da\u00df der Hungerk\u00fcnstler mit einem Wutausbruch\r\nantwortete und zum Schrecken aller wie ein Tier an dem Gitter zu r\u00fctteln\r\nbegann. Doch hatte f\u00fcr solche Zust\u00e4nde der Impresario ein Strafmittel,\r\ndas er gern anwandte. Er entschuldigte den Hungerk\u00fcnstler vor\r\nversammeltem Publikum, gab zu, da\u00df nur die durch das Hungern\r\nhervorgerufene, f\u00fcr satte Menschen nicht ohne weiteres begreifliche\r\nReizbarkeit das Benehmen des Hungerk\u00fcnstlers verzeihlich machen k\u00f6nne;\r\nkam dann im Zusammenhang damit auch auf die ebenso zu erkl\u00e4rende\r\nBehauptung des Hungerk\u00fcnstlers zu sprechen, er k\u00f6nnte noch viel l\u00e4nger\r\nhungern, als er hungere; lobte das hohe Streben, den guten Willen, die\r\ngro\u00dfe Selbstverleugnung, die gewi\u00df auch in dieser Behauptung enthalten\r\nseien; suchte dann aber die Behauptung einfach genug durch Vorzeigen von\r\nPhotographien, die gleichzeitig verkauft wurden, zu widerlegen, denn auf\r\nden Bildern sah man den Hungerk\u00fcnstler an einem vierzigsten Hungertag,\r\nim Bett, fast verl\u00f6scht vor Entkr\u00e4ftung. Diese dem Hungerk\u00fcnstler zwar\r\nwohlbekannte, immer aber von neuem ihn entnervende Verdrehung der\r\nWahrheit war ihm zuviel. Was die Folge der vorzeitigen Beendigung\r\ndes Hungerns war, stellte man hier als die Ursache dar! Gegen diesen\r\nUnverstand, gegen diese Welt des Unverstandes zu k\u00e4mpfen, war unm\u00f6glich.\r\nNoch hatte er immer wieder in gutem Glauben begierig am Gitter dem\r\nImpresario zugeh\u00f6rt, beim Erscheinen der Photographien aber lie\u00df er\r\ndas Gitter jedesmal los, sank mit Seufzen ins Stroh zur\u00fcck, und das\r\nberuhigte Publikum konnte wieder herankommen und ihn besichtigen.\r\n\r\nWenn die Zeugen solcher Szenen ein paar Jahre sp\u00e4ter daran\r\nzur\u00fcckdachten, wurden sie sich oft selbst unverst\u00e4ndlich. Denn\r\ninzwischen war jener erw\u00e4hnte Umschwung eingetreten; fast pl\u00f6tzlich\r\nwar das geschehen; es mochte tiefere Gr\u00fcnde haben, aber wem lag\r\ndaran, sie aufzufinden; jedenfalls sah sich eines Tages der verw\u00f6hnte\r\nHungerk\u00fcnstler von der vergn\u00fcgungss\u00fcchtigen Menge verlassen, die lieber\r\nzu anderen Schaustellungen str\u00f6mte. Noch einmal jagte der Impresario mit\r\nihm durch halb Europa, um zu sehn, ob sich nicht noch hie und da das\r\nalte Interesse wiederf\u00e4nde; alles vergeblich; wie in einem geheimen\r\nEinverst\u00e4ndnis hatte sich \u00fcberall geradezu eine Abneigung gegen das\r\nSchauhungern ausgebildet. Nat\u00fcrlich hatte das in Wirklichkeit nicht\r\npl\u00f6tzlich so kommen k\u00f6nnen, und man erinnerte sich jetzt nachtr\u00e4glich\r\nan manche zu ihrer Zeit im Rausch der Erfolge nicht gen\u00fcgend beachtete,\r\nnicht gen\u00fcgend unterdr\u00fcckte Vorboten, aber jetzt etwas dagegen zu\r\nunternehmen, war zu sp\u00e4t. Zwar war es sicher, da\u00df einmal auch f\u00fcr das\r\nHungern wieder die Zeit kommen werde, aber f\u00fcr die Lebenden war das kein\r\nTrost. Was sollte nun der Hungerk\u00fcnstler tun? Der, welchen Tausende\r\numjubelt hatten, konnte sich nicht in Schaubuden auf kleinen Jahrm\u00e4rkten\r\nzeigen, und um einen andern Beruf zu ergreifen, war der Hungerk\u00fcnstler\r\nnicht nur zu alt, sondern vor allem dem Hungern allzu fanatisch ergeben.\r\nSo verabschiedete er denn den Impresario, den Genossen einer Laufbahn\r\nohnegleichen, und lie\u00df sich von einem gro\u00dfen Zirkus schnell engagieren;\r\num seine Empfindlichkeit zu schonen, sah er die Vertragsbedingungen gar\r\nnicht an.\r\n\r\nEin gro\u00dfer Zirkus mit seiner Unzahl von einander immer wieder\r\nausgleichenden und erg\u00e4nzenden Menschen und Tieren und Apparaten kann\r\njeden und zu jeder Zeit gebrauchen, auch einen Hungerk\u00fcnstler, bei\r\nentsprechend bescheidenen Anspr\u00fcchen nat\u00fcrlich, und au\u00dferdem war es\r\nja in diesem besonderen Fall nicht nur der Hungerk\u00fcnstler selbst, der\r\nengagiert wurde, sondern auch sein alter ber\u00fchmter Name, ja man konnte\r\nbei der Eigenart dieser im zunehmenden Alter nicht abnehmenden Kunst\r\nnicht einmal sagen, da\u00df ein ausgedienter, nicht mehr auf der H\u00f6he seines\r\nK\u00f6nnens stehender K\u00fcnstler sich in einen ruhigen Zirkusposten fl\u00fcchten\r\nwolle, im Gegenteil, der Hungerk\u00fcnstler versicherte, da\u00df er, was\r\ndurchaus glaubw\u00fcrdig war, eben so gut hungere wie fr\u00fcher, ja er\r\nbehauptete sogar, er werde, wenn man ihm seinen Willen lasse, und dies\r\nversprach man ihm ohne weiteres, eigentlich erst jetzt die Welt in\r\nberechtigtes Erstaunen setzen, eine Behauptung allerdings, die mit\r\nR\u00fccksicht auf die Zeitstimmung, welche der Hungerk\u00fcnstler im Eifer\r\nleicht verga\u00df bei den Fachleuten nur ein L\u00e4cheln hervorrief.\r\n\r\nIm Grunde aber verlor auch der Hungerk\u00fcnstler den Blick f\u00fcr die\r\nwirklichen Verh\u00e4ltnisse nicht und nahm es als selbstverst\u00e4ndlich hin,\r\nda\u00df man ihn mit seinem K\u00e4fig nicht etwa als Glanznummer mitten in\r\ndie Manege stellte, sondern drau\u00dfen an einem im \u00fcbrigen recht gut\r\nzug\u00e4nglichen Ort in der N\u00e4he der Stallungen unterbrachte. Gro\u00dfe, bunt\r\ngemalte Aufschriften umrahmten den K\u00e4fig und verk\u00fcndeten, was dort\r\nzu sehen war. Wenn das Publikum in den Pausen der Vorstellung zu den\r\nSt\u00e4llen dr\u00e4ngte, um die Tiere zu besichtigen, war es fast unvermeidlich,\r\nda\u00df es beim Hungerk\u00fcnstler vor\u00fcberkam und ein wenig dort haltmachte, man\r\nw\u00e4re vielleicht l\u00e4nger bei ihm geblieben, wenn nicht in dem schmalen\r\nGang die Nachdr\u00e4ngenden, welche diesen Aufenthalt auf dem Weg zu den\r\nersehnten St\u00e4llen nicht verstanden, eine l\u00e4ngere ruhige Betrachtung\r\nunm\u00f6glich gemacht h\u00e4tten. Dieses war auch der Grund, warum der\r\nHungerk\u00fcnstler vor diesen Besuchszeiten, die er als seinen Lebenszweck\r\nnat\u00fcrlich herbeiw\u00fcnschte, doch auch wieder zitterte. In der ersten Zeit\r\nhatte er die Vorstellungspausen kaum erwarten k\u00f6nnen; entz\u00fcckt hatte er\r\nder sich heranw\u00e4lzenden Menge entgegengesehn, bis er sich nur zu bald\r\n-- auch die hartn\u00e4ckigste, fast bewu\u00dfte Selbstt\u00e4uschung hielt den\r\nErfahrungen nicht stand -- davon \u00fcberzeugte, da\u00df es zumeist der Absicht\r\nnach, immer wieder, ausnahmslos, lauter Stallbesucher waren. Und dieser\r\nAnblick von der Ferne blieb noch immer der sch\u00f6nste. Denn wenn sie bis\r\nzu ihm herangekommen waren, umtobte ihn sofort Geschrei und Schimpfen\r\nder ununterbrochen neu sich bildenden Parteien, jener, welche -- sie\r\nwurde dem Hungerk\u00fcnstler bald die peinlichere -- ihn bequem ansehen\r\nwollte, nicht etwa aus Verst\u00e4ndnis, sondern aus Laune und Trotz, und\r\njener zweiten, die zun\u00e4chst nur nach den St\u00e4llen verlangte. War der\r\ngro\u00dfe Haufe vor\u00fcber, dann kamen die Nachz\u00fcgler, und diese allerdings,\r\ndenen es nicht mehr verwehrt war, stehen zu bleiben, solange sie nur\r\nLust hatten, eilten mit langen Schritten, fast ohne Seitenblick,\r\nvor\u00fcber, um rechtzeitig zu den Tieren zu kommen. Und es war kein allzu\r\nh\u00e4ufiger Gl\u00fccksfall, da\u00df ein Familienvater mit seinen Kindern kam, mit\r\ndem Finger auf den Hungerk\u00fcnstler zeigte, ausf\u00fchrlich erkl\u00e4rte, um\r\nwas es sich hier handelte, von fr\u00fcheren Jahren erz\u00e4hlte, wo er bei\r\n\u00e4hnlichen, aber unvergleichlich gro\u00dfartigeren Vorf\u00fchrungen gewesen war,\r\nund dann die Kinder, wegen ihrer ungen\u00fcgenden Vorbereitung von Schule\r\nund Leben her, zwar immer noch verst\u00e4ndnislos blieben -- was war ihnen\r\nHungern? -- aber doch in dem Glanz ihrer forschenden Augen etwas von\r\nneuen, kommenden, gn\u00e4digeren Zeiten verrieten. Vielleicht, so sagte sich\r\nder Hungerk\u00fcnstler dann manchmal, w\u00fcrde alles doch ein wenig besser\r\nwerden, wenn sein Standort nicht gar so nahe bei den St\u00e4llen w\u00e4re. Den\r\nLeuten wurde dadurch die Wahl zu leicht gemacht, nicht zu reden davon,\r\nda\u00df ihn die Ausd\u00fcnstungen der St\u00e4lle, die Unruhe der Tiere in der Nacht,\r\ndas Vor\u00fcbertragen der rohen Fleischst\u00fccke f\u00fcr die Raubtiere, die Schreie\r\nbei der F\u00fctterung sehr verletzten und dauernd bedr\u00fcckten. Aber bei der\r\nDirektion vorstellig zu werden, wagte er nicht; immerhin verdankte er\r\nja den Tieren die Menge der Besucher, unter denen sich hie und da auch\r\nein f\u00fcr ihn Bestimmter finden konnte, und wer wu\u00dfte, wohin man ihn\r\nverstecken w\u00fcrde, wenn er an seine Existenz erinnern wollte und damit\r\nauch daran, da\u00df er, genau genommen, nur ein Hindernis auf dem Weg zu den\r\nSt\u00e4llen war.\r\n\r\nEin kleines Hindernis allerdings, ein immer kleiner werdendes Hindernis.\r\nMan gew\u00f6hnte sich an die Sonderbarkeit, in den heutigen Zeiten\r\nAufmerksamkeit f\u00fcr einen Hungerk\u00fcnstler beanspruchen zu wollen, und mit\r\ndieser Gew\u00f6hnung war das Urteil \u00fcber ihn gesprochen. Er mochte so gut\r\nhungern, als er nur konnte, und er tat es, aber nichts konnte ihn mehr\r\nretten, man ging an ihm vor\u00fcber. Versuche, jemandem die Hungerkunst zu\r\nerkl\u00e4ren! Wer es nicht f\u00fchlt, dem kann man es nicht begreiflich machen.\r\nDie sch\u00f6nen Aufschriften wurden schmutzig und unleserlich, man ri\u00df sie\r\nherunter, niemandem fiel es ein, sie zu ersetzen; das T\u00e4felchen mit der\r\nZiffer der abgeleisteten Hungertage, das in der ersten Zeit sorgf\u00e4ltig\r\nt\u00e4glich erneut worden war, blieb schon l\u00e4ngst immer das gleiche, denn\r\nnach den ersten Wochen war das Personal selbst dieser kleinen Arbeit\r\n\u00fcberdr\u00fcssig geworden; und so hungerte zwar der Hungerk\u00fcnstler weiter,\r\nwie er es fr\u00fcher einmal ertr\u00e4umt hatte, und es gelang ihm ohne M\u00fche ganz\r\nso, wie er es damals vorausgesagt hatte, aber niemand z\u00e4hlte die Tage,\r\nniemand, nicht einmal der Hungerk\u00fcnstler selbst wu\u00dfte, wie gro\u00df die\r\nLeistung schon war, und sein Herz wurde schwer. Und wenn einmal in der\r\nZeit ein M\u00fc\u00dfigg\u00e4nger stehen blieb, sich \u00fcber die alte Ziffer lustig\r\nmachte und von Schwindel sprach, so war das in diesem Sinn die d\u00fcmmste\r\nL\u00fcge, welche Gleichg\u00fcltigkeit und eingeborene B\u00f6sartigkeit erfinden\r\nkonnte, denn nicht der Hungerk\u00fcnstler betrog, er arbeitete ehrlich, aber\r\ndie Welt betrog ihn um seinen Lohn.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDoch vergingen wieder viele Tage, und auch das nahm ein Ende. Einmal\r\nfiel einem Aufseher der K\u00e4fig auf, und er fragte die Diener, warum man\r\nhier diesen gut brauchbaren K\u00e4fig mit dem verfaulten Stroh drinnen\r\nunben\u00fctzt stehen lasse; niemand wu\u00dfte es, bis sich einer mit Hilfe der\r\nZiffertafel an den Hungerk\u00fcnstler erinnerte. Man r\u00fchrte mit Stangen das\r\nStroh auf und fand den Hungerk\u00fcnstler darin. \u00bbDu hungerst noch immer?\u00ab\r\nfragte der Aufseher, \u00bbwann wirst du denn endlich aufh\u00f6ren?\u00ab \u00bbVerzeiht\r\nmir alle\u00ab, fl\u00fcsterte der Hungerk\u00fcnstler; nur der Aufseher, der das Ohr\r\nans Gitter hielt, verstand ihn. \u00bbGewi\u00df,\u00ab sagte der Aufseher und legte\r\nden Finger an die Stirn, um damit den Zustand des Hungerk\u00fcnstlers dem\r\nPersonal anzudeuten, \u00bbwir verzeihen dir.\u00ab \u00bbImmerfort wollte ich, da\u00df ihr\r\nmein Hungern bewundert\u00ab, sagte der Hungerk\u00fcnstler. \u00bbWir bewundern es\r\nauch\u00ab, sagte der Aufseher entgegenkommend. \u00bbIhr sollt es aber nicht\r\nbewundern\u00ab, sagte der Hungerk\u00fcnstler. \u00bbNun, dann bewundern wir es also\r\nnicht,\u00ab sagte der Aufseher, \u00bbwarum sollen wir es denn nicht bewundern?\u00ab\r\n\u00bbWeil ich hungern mu\u00df, ich kann nicht anders\u00ab, sagte der Hungerk\u00fcnstler.\r\n\u00bbDa sieh mal einer,\u00ab sagte der Aufseher, \u00bbwarum kannst du denn nicht\r\nanders?\u00ab \u00bbWeil ich,\u00ab sagte der Hungerk\u00fcnstler, hob das K\u00f6pfchen ein\r\nwenig und sprach mit wie zum Ku\u00df gespitzten Lippen gerade in das Ohr\r\ndes Aufsehers hinein, damit nichts verloren ginge, \u00bbweil ich nicht die\r\nSpeise finden konnte, die mir schmeckt. H\u00e4tte ich sie gefunden, glaube\r\nmir, ich h\u00e4tte kein Aufsehen gemacht und mich vollgegessen wie du und\r\nalle.\u00ab Das waren die letzten Worte, aber noch in seinen gebrochenen\r\nAugen war die feste, wenn auch nicht mehr stolze \u00dcberzeugung, da\u00df er\r\nweiterhungre.\r\n\r\n\u00bbNun macht aber Ordnung!\u00ab, sagte der Aufseher, und man begrub den\r\nHungerk\u00fcnstler samt dem Stroh. In den K\u00e4fig aber gab man einen jungen\r\nPanther. Es war eine selbst dem stumpfsten Sinn f\u00fchlbare Erholung, in\r\ndem so lange \u00f6den K\u00e4fig dieses wilde Tier sich herumwerfen zu sehn. Ihm\r\nfehlte nichts. Die Nahrung, die ihm schmeckte, brachten ihm ohne langes\r\nNachdenken die W\u00e4chter; nicht einmal die Freiheit schien er zu vermissen;\r\ndieser edle, mit allem N\u00f6tigen bis knapp zum Zerrei\u00dfen ausgestattete\r\nK\u00f6rper schien auch die Freiheit mit sich herumzutragen; irgendwo im\r\nGebi\u00df schien sie zu stecken; und die Freude am Leben kam mit derart\r\nstarker Glut aus seinem Rachen, da\u00df es f\u00fcr die Zuschauer nicht leicht\r\nwar, ihr standzuhalten. Aber sie \u00fcberwanden sich, umdr\u00e4ngten den K\u00e4fig\r\nund wollten sich gar nicht fortr\u00fchren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Ein Hungerk\u00fcnstler, by Franz Kafka\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EIN HUNGERK\u00dcNSTLER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 30655-8.txt or 30655-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/6/5/30655/\r\n\r\nProduced by Jana Srna\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\r\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\r\npage at http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n", "author": "Franz Kafka", "tags": ["20th century", "Belletristik", "circus", "collection", "Czech literature", "Czech Republic", "existentialism", "fiction", "Franz Kafka", "German", "German literature", "Jewish", "Kafka", "literature", "Nederlandstalig", "Prague", "prose", "r1977", "Roman", "salamanders", "short stories", "short story", "stories"], "title": "A Hunger Artist"}, {"text": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml-rdfa-1.dtd\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n\n\n<head>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.icon   { background: transparent url(/pics/sprite.png?1424256290) 0 0 no-repeat; }\n</style>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/css/pg-desktop-one.css?1424256290\" />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">//<![CDATA[\nvar json_search     = \"/ebooks/suggest/\";\nvar mobile_url      = \"//m.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/?format=mobile\";\nvar canonical_url   = \"http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/\";\nvar lang            = \"en_US\";\nvar fb_lang         = \"en_US\"; /* FB accepts only xx_XX */\nvar msg_load_more   = \"Load More Results\u2026\";\nvar page_mode       = \"screen\";\nvar dialog_title    = \"\";\nvar dialog_message  = \"\";\n//]]></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/pg-desktop-one.js?1424256290\"></script>\n<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"/pics/favicon\" />\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/\" />\n<link rel=\"search\" type=\"application/opensearchdescription+xml\" title=\"Search Project Gutenberg\" href=\"//www.gutenberg.org/catalog/osd-books.xml\" />\n<link rel=\"alternate nofollow\" type=\"application/atom+xml;profile=opds-catalog\" title=\"OPDS feed\" href=\"/w/captcha/question/?format=opds\" />\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"/pics/apple-touch-icon\" />\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\" />\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Style-Type\" content=\"text/css\" />\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"en_US\" />\n<meta name=\"title\" content=\"Project Gutenberg\" />\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Project Gutenberg offers 48,205 free ebooks for Kindle, iPad, Nook, Android, and iPhone.\" />\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"ebook, ebooks, free ebooks, free books, book, books, audio books\" />\n<meta name=\"classification\" content=\"public\" />\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Project Gutenberg\" />\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Project Gutenberg offers 48,205 free ebooks for Kindle, iPad, Nook, Android, and iPhone.\" />\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"website\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/pics/logo-144x144.png\" />\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/\" />\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Project Gutenberg\" />\n<meta property=\"fb:app_id\" content=\"115319388529183\" />\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary\" />\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@gutenberg_new\" />\n<title>Captcha</title>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.ui-dialog-titlebar-close {\ndisplay: none;\n}\n#recaptcha_response_field {\nmargin-bottom: 1em;\nwidth: 300px;\n}\n.recaptcha_only_if_incorrect_sol {\ncolor: red;\n}\n</style>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//www.google.com/recaptcha/api/js/recaptcha_ajax.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nfunction on_recaptcha_loaded () {\n$('#need_javascript').hide ();\nRecaptcha.focus_response_field ();\n}\nvar RecaptchaOptions = {\ntheme: \"custom\",\ncustom_theme_widget: \"recaptcha_widget\",\ncallback: on_recaptcha_loaded\n};\nrequire (\n[\n'jquery',\n'jquery-ui/dialog',\n'jquery.cookie/jquery.cookie'\n],\nfunction (jquery, dialog, cookie) {\nif (jquery.cookie ('session_id')) {\njquery ('#need_cookies').hide ();\n}\nRecaptcha.create (\"6LfCKOwSAAAAAJL5QwhpdHZSr7kKr0b5_zl6HIXW\", \"id_captcha\", RecaptchaOptions);\nvar dlg = jquery ('#dialog');\ndlg.dialog ({\nwidth: 350,\nresizable: false,\nmodal: true,\ncloseOnEscape: false\n});\n});\n</script>\n</head>\n<body>\n<div id=\"mw-head-dummy\" class=\"noprint\"></div>\n<div id=\"content\">\n<div class=\"body\">\n<div id=\"dialog\" title=\"Are you human?\" class=\"hidden\">\n<p>You have used Project Gutenberg quite a lot today or clicked through it really fast.
